    "CallForPaper": "The 32nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP 2024)\nCharleroi, Belgium, October 28-31, 2024  Follow @IEEE_ICNP \n\nICNP, the IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols, is the premier conference covering all aspects of network protocol research, including design, analysis, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. ICNP 2024 will be organized by UCLouvain and the University of Mons in Charleroi, Belgium on October 28-31, 2024.\n\nScope\n\nThe conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to the field of network protocol research. Both experimental studies as well as formal investigations are equally welcome. Topics traditionally of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nAll aspects of network protocol research including design, specification, verification, implementation, measurement, testing, and analysis.\nProtocols for data center networks, software-defined networks, information-centric networking (ICN), AI/ML clusters, Internet of Things, cellular networks, sensor networks, satellite networks, vehicular networks, and wireless networks.\nDomain-specific solutions, including protocols for network security, routing, user privacy, or network management.\nNetwork protocols meet AI/ML, e.g., application of AI/ML to improve network protocols and operations; networking and protocols for improving the performance of AI/ML systems.\nContributions to network architecture, e.g., algorithms and protocols for network virtualization or future Internet architectures.\nContributions to other areas of data communications to the extent that they articulate a strong connection to network protocols, for example by discussing potential implications on the design, implementation or performance of certain types of network protocols.\n\nAuthors who are unsure whether or not their submissions might fit the scope of the conference are welcome to contact the Program Committee Co-Chairs.\n\nTechnical Program Chairs\n\nOlivier Bonaventure (UCLouvain, Belgium)\nKai Chen (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR)\n\nImportant Dates\nTitle / Abstract registration:\tMay 17, 2024 (AoE)\nFull paper submission:\tMay 24, 2024 (AoE)\nNotification of acceptance:\tJuly 28, 2024\nCamera ready version:\tSeptember 16, 2024\nPaper Formatting\n\nPaper submissions should adhere to the IEEE Conference formatting requirements using the templates available here, and should not exceed 10 pages excluding references. It is the authors' responsibility to produce readable submissions that comply with the formatting constraints. Violating the formatting requirements to squeeze in additional materials will result in a submission being returned without being reviewed. The authors would have developed software or collected data for the paper are encouraged to release their artefacts and describe them in the submitted paper. To preserve anonymity, the artefacts will only be publicly released upon paper acceptance.\n\nSubmission and Anonymity Policy\n\nPapers submitted to the conference will be reviewed through a double-blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers (and that of the reviewers from the authors). Achieving this goal requires some care to, on the one hand, preserve the anonymity of your submission, and on the other hand ensuring proper coverage of related past work, including your own. While this requirement may seem challenging, the few basic steps listed below will go a long way towards achieving the desired outcome:\n\nRemove all authors' identifiers, e.g., names, emails, and affiliations, from the title page.\nRemove acknowledgments of and identifiers of funding sources.\nUse anonymous names for your files, as source file names are often embedded in the final output you generate, and therefore accessible as comments.\nWhen referring to your own related work, refer to it in the third person as you would with any other related work by another author.\n\nBesides anonymizing your submission, double-blind reviewing also imposes additional requirements on both authors and reviewers. Specifically, while it is permissible for authors to give local talks on their work and release their paper on a non-peer-reviewed location, e.g., an institutional repository or even arXiv, care should be exercised to limit public exposure as much as possible. This requirement includes refraining from advertising the work on mailing lists and public forums, and in general limiting as much as possible the odds that program committee members be exposed to the work and the authors’ identity. Conversely, program committee members will be advised to neither actively seek to “reverse engineer” the authors’ identity, nor to directly share with other program committee members any such information they may have acquired. All questions regarding possible breaches of the anonymity covenant that underlies the double-blind review process will be adjudicated by the Program Committee Co-Chairs. All papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.\n\nAll papers will be provisionally accepted, and the final acceptance of any paper will be subject to shepherding by a member of the Program Committee.\n\nSubmission and Plagiarism Policy\n\nPapers must present original contributions and can neither be previously published nor under review by another conference or journal. Papers containing plagiarized materials will be subject to the IEEE plagiarism policy and possible penalties and will be rejected without being reviewed.\n\nBest Paper Award and Fast-Track Journal Publication\n\nOne of the accepted papers will be selected for the Best Paper award and will be fast tracked to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, with a streamlined journal review process.\n\nPresentation and Registration Requirements\n\nICNP 2024 will be held physically in-person in Charleroi, Belgium. IEEE ICNP requires that at least one of the authors of any accepted paper must register for the conference at the full rate and be available to present the paper at the conference. Any paper that is not presented by an author of the paper will be withdrawn from the proceedings and thus from IEEE Xplore."

    "CallForPaper": "The IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA) is the premier gathering of practitioners and researchers interested in software architecture, component-based software engineering, and quality aspects of complex software systems. The 21st IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA 2024) continues the tradition of a working conference, where practitioners and researchers meet and where software architects can explain the challenges they face and try to influence the future of the field. Interactive working sessions will be the place where researchers meet practitioners to identify opportunities to create the future.\n\nRecent advances in capabilities and availability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) now allow users to generate text, source code, graphics, videos, and 3D models based on natural language descriptions. Software architects are already starting to use these tools to rationalize design decisions, to explore technology options, to synthesize source code based on patterns, and to generate architecture diagrams. The theme of ICSA 2024 is thus “Software Architecture in the Age of Generative AI”. The conference welcomes contributions exploring the potentials and risks of this new technology for software architecture. We are particularly interested in soliciting papers describing novel tools, techniques, and methods to support software architects using generative AI. We are also looking for software and system architecture case studies that successfully or unsuccessfully applied this new technology.\n\nBesides the main theme, we call on both researchers and practitioners for contributions that advance our understanding of architectures in real-world software, facilitate empirical research by making architectural artifacts and tools publicly available, and promote replicability of results through common datasets and benchmarks. We welcome original papers that explore and explain the role of architecture in current systems and future systems. This conference looks at what can be learned from our software architecture history, experience, studies, and best practices.\n\nImportant Dates\nAbstracts due: November 24th, 2023\nFull papers due: December 1st, 2023\nNotification of acceptance: February 4th, 2024\nCamera-ready due: February 18th, 2024\n\nNotes: All deadlines are 23:59h AoE (anywhere on Earth)\n\nTopics\nTopics of interest for the conference include (but are not limited to) the following:\nRequirements & Architecture\nStakeholder management and collaborating with other domains\nStakeholder management and collaborating with other domains\nLinking architecture to requirements and/or implementation\nMethods to address the intertwining of specification and design\nSustainability, ethics, business, financial, and managerial aspects of software architecture\nArchitecture Design\nModel-driven architecture\nComponent-based software engineering\nArchitecture frameworks and architecture description languages\nReusable architectural solutions & architecture knowledge management\nCloud-native Computing & Architecture\nMicroservices & containerization\nServerless platforms & novel forms of virtualization (WASM, MicroVMs, etc.)\nEvent-driven architectures\nObservability & Distributed Tracing\nArchitecture Evaluation\nEvaluating quality aspects (e.g., security, performance, reliability, evolvability)\nAI/ML techniques for architecture\nArchitecture conformance checking\nLightweight evaluation methods\nArchitecture & Life-cycle\nAutomatic extraction and generation of software architecture descriptions\nArchitecture & continuous integration/delivery, and DevOps\nRefactoring and evolving architecture design decisions and solutions\nAgile architecting, continuous architecting, and other approaches to architecting\nArchitecture & Architects\nRoles and responsibilities for software architects\nTraining, soft skills, coaching, mentoring, education, and certification\nArchitecture for equality, diversity and inclusion\nState-of-the-art and state-of-practice in software architecture\nArchitecture for specific types of systems, such as:\nEdge / Fog / Internet of Things (IoT) systems / IoB systems\nAI / ML systems & systems using blockchains\nCyber-physical systems\nSelf-adaptive & autonomous systems\nArchitecture & Generative AI:\nDesign assistance & identification of architectural patterns\nDecision making support, comparing technologies, evaluating trade-offs\nGenerating source code to facilitate implementing architecture designs\nReviewing designs, identifying inconsistencies, and suggesting improvements\nOpen Science Principles\nThe ICSA conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability. For more background information, please refer to the Artefact Evaluation Track (AET).\n\nAuthors have an additional choice to make, in that they can either:\n\nopt to make data and/or code available; in this case, if accepted, their paper will be automatically submitted to AET for check of criteria, and whether badges can be assigned to the paper; or\nopt not to make their research artifacts and datasets accessible to the program committee; in that case, authors are asked to comment in their submitted paper on why this is not possible, practical, or desirable. This statement should be included at the end of the introduction section and may be deleted in the final version of the paper if accepted. Possible reasons may involve privacy restrictions and/or non-disclosure agreements.\n\nSharing of research artifacts is desired but not mandatory for submission or acceptance. The program committee members, however, may use this information to inform their decision.\n\nSubmission\n\nWe solicit the submission of technical research papers that describe original and significant results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, or experimental work in software architecture. The submissions will be evaluated based on novelty, soundness, significance/relevance, open science principles (as outlined above), and presentation quality, in that order. All submissions must conform to the IEEE paper formatting and submission instructions and must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two additional pages containing only references are permitted. The submissions must conform to the author instructions as well as to the IEEE Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text\n\nPlease note that ICSA 2024 will pursue a double-blind review process for technical research papers only, therefore all technical research paper submissions have to fulfill the double-blind reviewing requirements. Submissions that disregard these review requirements will be desk-rejected without review. For artifacts that will be published following the open science principles (see above), we ask that authors undertake reasonable, possibly non-exhaustive steps to not disclose their identity, e.g., by anonymizing author names, handles, affiliations, and URLs. Leakage of information in additional artifacts will not lead to desk rejection. Reviewers will be asked to treat artifacts and papers as confidential.\n\nAll papers are to be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system by the submission deadline, and must not have been published before or be submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration at ICSA. All submissions will be checked with an anti-plagiarism tool.\n\nPublication\nAll accepted technical research papers will be published in the ICSA 2024 main proceedings, and appear in IEEE Xplore Digital Library.\n\nThe authors of submission that are rejected as technical research papers – but for which reviews show a strong potential for positively influencing the state of the art or state of practice in software architecture, or strong potential to stimulate discussion – will be invited to submit a short paper (up to 8 pages including references) or a poster (poster presented at the conference + up to 4 pages (including references) describing their research. Short papers and poster summaries (up to 4 pages) will be published in the ICSA 2024 companion proceedings.\n\nNote that at least one author of an accepted contribution is required to register and present the work at the conference. An in-person presentation is required.\nResearch Track Chairs\n\nRomina Spalazzese, Malmö University, Sweden\nHeiko Koziolek, ABB Research, Germany"

Topics of interest include the following and are grouped into the following seven research areas.\n\nEach submission will need to indicate one of these seven areas as the chosen area. Optionally, the authors can consider adding an additional area. A paper may be moved from the chosen area(s) to another focus area at the discretion of the program chairs. Program chairs will ultimately assign a paper to an area chair, considering the authors’ selection, the paper’s content, and other factors such as (if applicable) possible conflicts of interest.\n\nAI and software engineering, Auto-coding\nSE for Machine learning systems\nMachine learning for SE tasks\nRecommender systems\nAutonomic systems and self-healing systems\nProgram synthesis\nProgram repair\nAI for DevOps\nCode generation from machine learning models\nAnalytics\nMining software repositories, communication platforms, and novel software engineering data sources\nApps and app store analysis\nSoftware ecosystems\nConfiguration management\nSoftware visualization\nData-driven user experience understanding and improvement\nData driven decision making in software engineering\nDependability and Security\nFormal methods\nModel Checking\nReliability and Safety\nVulnerability detection to enhance software security\nSystem design to enhance software security\nPrivacy, Robustness, Fairness: Checking and Enforcement\nEmbedded and cyber-physical systems: modeling and validation\nEvolution\nEvolution and maintenance\nAPI design and evolution\nRelease engineering and DevOps\nSoftware reuse\nRefactoring and program differencing\nProgram comprehension\nReverse engineering\nEnvironments and software development tools\nTraceability to understand evolution\nHuman and Social aspects\nHuman and organizational aspects of software engineering\nInteraction in programming environments and software engineering tools\nDistributed and collaborative software engineering\nAgile methods and software processes\nSoftware economics\nCommunity-based software engineering (e.g., open source, crowdsourcing)\nEthics in software engineering\nGreen and sustainable technologies\nResearch on diversity, inclusion and social issues in software engineering\nRequirements and modeling\nRequirements Engineering (incl. non-functional requirements)\nDesign for quality, including privacy and security by design\nFeedback, user and requirements management\nModelling and Model-Driven Engineering\nSoftware Architecture and Design\nVariability and product lines\nSystems and software traceability\nSoftware services and cloud-based systems\nTesting and analysis\nSoftware testing\nProgram analysis\nDebugging and fault localization\nProgramming languages: developer-centric issues\nAutomated test generation techniques such as search and symbolic execution\nTesting and analysis of non-functional properties\nGUI testing\nMobile application testing\nScope\n\nSince the authors will choose an area for their submission, the scope of each area becomes important. Some submissions may relate to multiple areas. In such cases, the authors should choose the area for which their paper brings the maximum new insights. Moreover, authors also have the choice of indicating an alternate area for each paper.\n\nSimilarly, for certain papers. authors may have a question whether it belongs to any area, or it is simply out of scope. For such cases, we recommend the authors to judge whether their paper brings new insights for software engineering. As an example, a formal methods paper with a focus on hardware verification may be deemed out of scope for ICSE. In general, papers which only peripherally concern software engineering and do not give new insights from the software engineering perspective would be less relevant to ICSE. Our goal is however to be descriptive, rather than prescriptive, to enable authors to make their own decisions about relevance.\n\nDual Submission Cycles – New for ICSE 2024\n\nSince ICSE 2024 will have a different timeline from previous ICSEs, we request authors to kindly take note of the dates. The dates for the two submission cycles are as follows\n\nFirst submission cycle\n\nSubmission: March 29, 2023\nNotification: June 2, 2023\nRevision due: July 10, 2023\nFinal Decisions: August 24, 2023\nCamera-ready: Sept 15, 2023\n\nSecond submission cycle\n\nSubmission: August 1, 2023\nNotification: October 10, 2023\nRevision due: Nov 17, 2023\nFinal Decisions: Dec 15, 2023\nCamera ready: Jan 12, 2024\n\nPapers accepted for the first submission cycle of ICSE 24 will be available in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries after the camera-ready deadline of September 15 2023. Once papers have been reviewed, authors will be able to see the full reviews, including the reviewer scores. There is no rebuttal phase for either cycle.\n\nReview Criteria\n\nEach paper submitted to the Research Track will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\ni) Novelty: The novelty and innovativeness of contributed solutions, problem formulations, methodologies, theories and/or evaluations, i.e., the extent to which the paper is sufficiently original with respect to state-of-the-art.\n\nii) Rigor: The soundness, clarity and depth of a technical or theoretical contribution, and the level of thoroughness and completeness of an evaluation.\n\niii) Relevance: The significance and/or potential impact of the research to the field of software engineering.\n\niv) Verifiability and Transparency: The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works; to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted; and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. Any artifacts attached to or linked from the paper may be checked by one reviewer.\n\nv) Presentation: The clarity of the exposition in the paper.\n\nReviewers will carefully consider all of the above criteria during the review process, and authors should take great care in clearly addressing them all. The paper should clearly explain and justify the claimed contributions. Each paper will be handled by an area chair who will ensure reviewing consistency among papers submitted within that area.\n\nThe outcome of each paper will be one of the following Accept, Conditional Accept, Revision, Reject. Note that papers which are Accepted straight-away may still involve changes by authors in the camera-ready version, but these changes will not be checked any further by PC. We now elaborate the Conditional Accept and the Revision outcomes in the following.\n\nConditional Accept\n\nAuthors of papers receiving a Conditional Accept decision are expected to submit the revised papers with changes marked in a different color, such as using LaTeXdiff. The authors also need to submit an “Author Response” document capturing the authors’ response to each reviewer comment and how those comments were addressed in the revision. This is similar to the “Summary of Changes and Response” document that is typically submitted by authors for a journal paper major revision. The reviewers will check the revised paper against the original paper and the suggested changes. Conditional Accepts will be checked by only one member of the Program Committee, and this will be done in one pass. We expect all papers receiving Conditional Accept to be accepted, even though this is not guaranteed.\n\nRevisions\n\nPapers submitted can go through revisions in response to specific revision requests made by the reviewers. Authors of papers receiving a Revision decision are expected to submit the revised papers with changes marked in a different color, such as using LaTeXdiff. The authors also need to submit an “Author Response” document capturing the authors’ response to each reviewer comment and how those comments were addressed in the revision. This is similar to the “Summary of Changes and Response” document that is typically submitted by authors for a journal paper major revision. Authors may use the revision opportunity to revise and improve the paper, but should not use this to submit a substantially different paper. The reviewers will check the revised paper against the original paper and the suggested changes. Revised papers will be examined by the same set of reviewers. An unsatisfactory revised paper will be rejected.\n\nRe-submissions of rejected papers\n\nAuthors of papers which receive a REJECT decision in the first submission cycle are strongly discouraged from re-submitting it to the second submission cycle. However, in exceptional cases where the authors feel that the reviewers misunderstood their paper, authors can re-submit their paper to the second submission cycle with a “Clarifications and Summary of Improvements” document stating how they have changed the paper. They should also include the past reviews as part of this document, for completeness. These papers will be treated as new submissions which may or may not get the same set of reviewers at the discretion of the PC chairs. Authors who try to bypass this guideline (e.g., by changing the paper title without significantly changing paper content, or by making small changes to the paper content) will have their papers desk-rejected by the PC chairs without further consideration. Papers rejected from the first or second submission cycle of ICSE2024 can be submitted to ICSE2025 without any restrictions.\n\nSubmission Process\n\nAll authors should use the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, as can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and anonymous (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document:\n\n\\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}\n\n\\acmConference[ICSE 2024]{46th International Conference on Software Engineering}{April 2024}{Lisbon, Portugal}\n\nAll submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version.\nSubmissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.\nBy submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Papers submitted to ICSE 2024 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSE 2024. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies.\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\nPlease ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.\nThe ICSE 2024 Research Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-anonymous review process. In particular:\nAuthors’ names must be omitted from the submission.\nAll references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.\nWhile authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to ICSE 2024.\nDuring review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. They should thus use a different paper title for any pre-print in arxiv or similar websites.\nFurther advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found in the Q&A page from prior ICSEs.\nBy submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the authorship policy of the ACM, and the authorship policy of the IEEE.\n\nSubmissions to the Technical Track that meet the above requirements can be made via the Research Track submission site by the submission deadline. Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review.\n\nSubmission site (second cycle August 2023): https://icse2024.hotcrp.com/\n\nWe encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.\n\nOpen Science Policy\n\nThe research track of ICSE 2024 is governed by the ICSE 2024 Open Science policies. The guiding principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public and, if possible, empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open artifact and open source principles. We encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data/artifacts to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, sharing is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified. We recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see this previously curated Q&A page.\n\nUpon submission to the research track, authors are asked\n\nto make their artifact available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) – and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or\n\nto include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and\n\nto indicate why they do not intend to make their data or study materials publicly available upon acceptance, if that is the case. The default understanding is that the data and/or other artifacts will be publicly available upon acceptance of a paper.\n\nWithdrawing a Paper\n\nAuthors can withdraw their paper at any moment until the final decision has been made, through the paper submission system. Resubmitting the paper to another venue before the final decision has been made without withdrawing from ICSE 2024 first is considered a violation of the concurrent submission policy, and will lead to automatic rejection from ICSE 2024 as well as any other venue adhering to this policy. Such violations may also be reported to appropriate organizations e.g. ACM and IEEE.\n\nConference Attendance Expectation\n\nIf a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ICSE 2024 and present the paper. We are assuming that the conference will be in-person, and if it is virtual or hybrid, virtual presentations may be possible. These matters will be discussed with authors closer to the date of the conference."

    "CallForPaper": "ICTIR 2024 invites submissions with substantial and original research on the theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval or topics from neighboring fields with a strong and clear connection to Information Retrieval.\n\nScope of the conference regarding methodology \n\nSubmissions can be purely theoretical or combine theoretical and practical work, either by investigating the validity of theoretical ideas through practical implementation or evaluation, or by providing sound theoretical explanations for important aspects of practical work. In any case, the theoretical part should be a significant, integral, and non-trivial part of the paper, and not just an add-on. The term \"theoretical\" is meant in a comprehensive sense, encompassing not only mathematical work, but also conceptual work, all kinds of modelling (for example, models of user behavior), problem generalizations, etc. When in doubt, ask the PC chairs.\n\nScope of the conference regarding topic\n\nThe conference welcomes papers on all aspects of Information Retrieval. See the Call for Papers for SIGIR 2024 for a list of included topics. Topics from neighboring fields are also in scope, as long as there is a clear and significant connection to Information Retrieval. When in doubt, ask the PC chairs.\n\nDouble-blind reviewing and submissions to arXiv\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.\n\nOn the one hand, a submission should not reveal the identity of the authors in any obvious way. In particular, the authors' names, affiliations, or email addresses should be nowhere visible in the submission. Any reference to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (that is, don't say \"our\" when referring to such work).\n\nOn the other hand, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Important references should be neither omitted nor anonymized. Authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, or give talks about them.\n\nThe purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try.\n\nSubmission guidelines and formal requirements\n\nThe page limit is 9 pages in ACM SIGIR style, excluding the references and the optional appendix. If there is an appendix, it is up to the reviewers whether they consider it or even look at it. The paper must be self-contained and understandable without reading the appendix if any. When published, the appendix will not be included. The 9 pages are an upper bound, not a target. Submissions will be evaluated based on the merits of their contents, not on the number of pages. When in doubt, ask the PC chairs.\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\n\nPlease ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.  The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.\n\nKey dates\n\nPaper submission deadline: April 25, 2024\nNotification of acceptance: June 6, 2024\nCamera-ready deadline: June 27, 2024\nConference date: July 13, 2024\nTime zone for all deadlines: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nWe encourage authors to follow this brief checklist to strengthen an  IR paper.\n\nResearch papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including any workshops at SIGIR 2024).\n\nSubmissions must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length (including figures, tables, proofs, acknowledgments, and any content except references and optional appendices), with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the ACM Website (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.\n\nFor LaTeX, the following should be used:\n\ndocumentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}\n\nSubmissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via OpenReview through the following link:\nhttps://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/SIGIR/ICTIR/2024/Conference\nNote that after paper decisions, reviews and meta-reviews of accepted papers will be made public, and authors of rejected papers have the option to make the reviews public as well. Reviewer and AC identities will remain anonymous.\n\nHannah Bast and Chenyan Xiong (ICTIR 2024 PC Chairs)\nNegin Rahimi (ICTIR 2024 Proceedings Chair)\nHarrie Oosterhuis (ICTIR 2024 General Chair)"
