    "CallForPaper": "Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search and optimization are a very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, discrete optimization and other areas of computer science and operations research. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field. \n\nSoCS serves researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, operations research, navigation and bioinformatics. We especially invite submissions presenting real-world applications of heuristic search.\n\nPapers exploring the boundaries between combinatorial search and planning & scheduling research are particularly welcome, given the co-location with ICAPS 2024.\nTopics of interest:\n\nTopics of interest include but are not limited to the following:\nAdversarial search\n\nAnalysis of search algorithms\n\nAutomated synthesis of lower bounds\n\nBidirectional search\n\nBounding and pruning techniques\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nCombinatorial puzzles\n\nContinuous problem solving\n\nConstraint search\n\nDeep learning in heuristics and search\n\nExternal-memory and parallel search\n\nHeuristics\n\nIncremental and active learning in search\n\nMachine learning for or in search algorithms\n\nMetareasoning and search\n\nMethodology and critiques of current practice\n\nModel-based search\n\nMulti-agent pathfinding\n\nPathfinding\n\nPortfolios of search algorithms\n\nProblem compilation\n\nProblem solving using search\n\nRandom vs. systematic search strategy selection\n\nReal-life applications\n\nReal-time search\n\nReinforcement learning and search\n\nSearch in goal-directed problem solving\n\nSearch space discretization for continuous state-space problems\n\nSearch-based diagnosis\n\nSearch in boolean satisfiability\n\nSearch in machine learning and big data analytics\n\nSearch methods in robotics\n\nSelf-configuring and self-tuning algorithms\n\nSymmetry handling\n\nTime, memory, and solution quality trade-offs\nTypes of submissions: \n\nWe encourage researchers to submit three categories of papers to the symposium: \n\nTechnical papers. Original long (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) papers are the standard category.  We welcome technical papers that report substantial original research in search or in related areas that are not under review in other archival conferences or journals. \n\nPosition papers. In addition to the main technical track, we encourage authors to submit original long  (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references)  and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) position papers discussing ideas and concepts related to heuristic and combinatorial search. Examples of position papers could include thoughtful critiques or bold new perspectives of the field, historical perspectives and analysis, technical discussions of various implementation techniques, methodological contributions, and insightful reports on new and demanding applications. \n\nExtended abstracts. To foster the exchange of ideas at SoCS, we encourage authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages including references) of original work, work-in-progress, or work that has recently appeared in or is under review at other venues such as AAAI/ICAPS/IJCAI.  Most archival conferences do not consider a 2-page extended abstract as preventing the submission of a full-length technical paper giving full details on the same work. For recently published work, authors can alternatively submit their original published paper for review (no page limit and no need to remove author information, but please indicate on the front page when and where the paper was published). If the submission is accepted, authors will then be required to submit a 2-page abstract for the proceedings. The submitted version itself will not be reprinted in the proceedings. All extended abstract submissions will be lightly reviewed in order to ensure that they are of interest to the SoCS community. \n\nAll accepted papers will be included in the proceedings.  Extended abstracts will likely be allocated poster presentations.\nSubmission instructions:\n\nSubmitted technical and position papers must be original and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. Double-blind reviewing will be provided, so submitted papers must omit author names and affiliations. \n\nExtended abstracts representing previously published work do not need to omit author information. To facilitate the review process, authors should mention on the first page (e.g., in the title) where this paper has been published or accepted for publication. For example, write in the title: \"A fascinating new search algorithm that beats A* (accepted for AAAI-2024)\".\n\nExtended abstracts representing under-reviewed work should omit author names and affiliations.  To facilitate the review process, authors should mention on the first page (e.g., in the title) where this paper is currently under review. For example, write in the title: \"A fascinating new search algorithm that beats A* (under review for AAAI-2024)\". \n\nExtended abstracts representing other types of work should also omit author names and affiliations.\n\nThe paper submission is a two-step process. First, the paper abstract needs to be registered in EasyChair by the Paper abstract submission deadline. Then, the full paper in PDF is due by the Paper submission deadline.  Remember, without registering your abstract on time, you will not be allowed to submit the paper later.\n\nSubmissions may be accompanied by supplementary material (video, appendices) which must also be anonymized.  Reviewers will not be required to consult such material - submitted paper should stand on their own.  Omission of supplementary material will not disadvantage a submission during review.\n\nSoCS will not accept any technical or position paper which, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their technical or position papers elsewhere during SoCS' s review period. These restrictions apply only to journals and conferences, not to workshops and similar specialized presentations with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. Authors will be required to confirm that their submissions conform to these requirements at the time of submission.\nCamera-ready instructions: \n\nThe page limit for camera-ready copies is the same as the page limit for submission papers. However, the last \"reference\" page of the long and short papers can include acknowledgment in addition to the references. We do not allow the purchase of extra pages. "

further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting.\n\nWe value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.\n\nSubmissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection.\n\nUSENIX ATC '24 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.\n\nPapers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.\n\nThere will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers.\n\nSubmission Type: Full vs. Short\n\nUSENIX ATC accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper. For further details, see the submission instructions.\n\nDeployed Systems Track\n\nUSENIX ATC '24 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track.\n\nAuthors' Response Period\n\nUSENIX ATC '24 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nAll submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '24 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.\n\nQuestions?\n\nPlease direct any questions to the program co-chairs at atc24chairs@usenix.org or to the USENIX office at submissionspolicy@usenix.org.\n\nGo to Submission Instructions"

Topics\n\nRefereed paper submissions are solicited in all areas relating to systems research in security and privacy. This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; USENIX Security is interested in all aspects of computing systems security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy of computing systems, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.\n\nSystem security\nOperating systems security\nWeb security\nMobile systems security\nDistributed systems security\nCloud computing security\nNetwork security\nIntrusion and anomaly detection and prevention\nNetwork infrastructure security\nDenial-of-service attacks and countermeasures\nWireless security\nSecurity analysis\nMalware analysis\nAnalysis of network and security protocols\nAttacks with novel insights, techniques, or results\nForensics and diagnostics for security\nAutomated security analysis of hardware designs and implementation\nAutomated security analysis of source code and binaries\nProgram analysis\nFuzzing and Vulnerability Discovery\nFormal methods for Security\nMachine learning security and privacy\nMachine learning applications to security and privacy\nMachine learning privacy issues and methods\nAdversarial machine learning\nData-driven security and measurement studies\nMeasurements of fraud, malware, spam\nMeasurements of human behavior and security\nPrivacy\nPrivacy metrics\nAnonymity\nWeb and mobile privacy\nPrivacy-preserving computation\nPrivacy attacks\nUsable security and privacy\nUser studies related to security and privacy\nHuman-centered security and privacy design\nLanguage-based security\nHardware security\nSecure computer architectures\nEmbedded systems security\nCyber-physical systems security\nMethods for detection of malicious or counterfeit hardware\nSide channels\nResearch on surveillance and censorship\nSocial issues and security\nResearch on computer security law and policy\nEthics of computer security research\nResearch on security education and training\nInformation manipulation, misinformation, and disinformation\nProtecting and understanding at-risk users\nEmerging threats, harassment, extremism, and online abuse\nApplications of cryptography\nAnalysis of deployed cryptography and cryptographic protocols\nCryptographic implementation analysis\nNew cryptographic protocols with real-world applications\nBlockchains and distributed ledger security\nSystematization of Knowledge\n\nStarting this year, USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.\n\nIt is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey) but also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.\n\nWhile both SoK and survey papers may involve summarizing existing research, the key difference is that a SoK paper provides a more structured and insightful overview, which might also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions. Please refer to the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy for recent SoK papers at https://oaklandsok.github.io/.\n\nWe encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the \"SoK:\" prefix to the title.\n\n \n\nRefereed Papers\n\nPapers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. Alternative arrangements will be made if global health concerns persist. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact conference@usenix.org.\n\nA major mission of the USENIX Association is to provide for the creation and dissemination of new knowledge. In keeping with this and as part of USENIX's open access policy, the Proceedings will be available online for registered attendees before the Symposium and for everyone starting on the opening day of the technical sessions. USENIX also allows authors to retain ownership of the copyright in their works, requesting only that USENIX be granted the right to be the first publisher of that work. See our sample consent form for the complete terms of publication.\n\nGo to Paper Submission Policies and Instructions page for more information.\n\nArtifact Evaluation\n\nAll authors of accepted USENIX Security '24 papers (including shepherd approved, but not major revisions) are encouraged to submit artifacts for Artifact Evaluation (AE). Artifacts can be submitted in the same cycle as the accepted paper or in any of the following cycles for 2024. Each submitted artifact will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC).\n\nView the Call for Artifacts.\n\nSymposium Activities\n\nInvited Talks and Panel Discussions\n\nInvited talks and panel discussions may be held in parallel with the refereed paper sessions. Please submit topic suggestions and talk and panel proposals via email to sec24it@usenix.org by Thursday, February 8, 2024.\n\nPoster Session\n\nWould you like to share a provocative opinion, an interesting preliminary work, or a cool idea that will spark discussion at this year's USENIX Security Symposium? The poster session is the perfect venue to introduce such new or ongoing work. Poster presenters will have the entirety of the evening reception to discuss their work, get exposure, and receive feedback from attendees.\n\nTo submit a poster, please submit a draft of your poster, in PDF (maximum size 36\" by 48\"), or a one-page abstract via the poster session submission form, which will be available here soon, by Tuesday, July 9, 2024. Decisions will be made by Tuesday, July 16, 2024. Posters will not be included in the proceedings but may be made available online if circumstances permit. Poster submissions must include the authors' names, affiliations, and contact information. At least one author of each accepted poster must register for and attend the Symposium to present the poster.\n\nGo to Paper Submission Policies and Instructions."

    "CallForPaper": "About the Conference\n\nThe aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.\n\nRelevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering.\n\nAlso encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing.\n\nProceedings will be published openly and electronically in January 2024 as SIAM ePubs. ALENEX is supported by SIAM.\n\nALENEX is co-located with the meetings listed below. Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop.\n\nThe following meetings will be held jointly:\nACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA24)\nAlgorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX24)\nSIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA24)"

    "CallForPaper": "Paper Categories\n\nContributions are sought in two categories:\n\nFull Papers (6 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions.\nShort Papers (2 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.\n\nBoth types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer reviewed, and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single blind, i.e, submissions need not be anonymized.\n\nThe format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.\n\nSubmission guidelines\n\nAll submissions and reviews will be managed within EasyChair. Submissions should be made via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ftfjp2024. There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).\n\nSubmissions should be in acmart/sigplan style, 10pt font. Formatting requirements are detailed on the SIGPLAN Author Information page (https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author).\n\nWe plan that, as in previous years, accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library, though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions."

    "CallForPaper": "SCOPE\n\nKnowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems and information systems. From the software development point of view, KE uses principles that are strongly related to software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering. Knowledge is considered to be produced by humans and structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic works. Currently, KE is mostly related with the construction of shared conceptual frameworks, often designated as ontologies, hence the relevance given to this term in our conference.\n\nOntology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, especially given the current web emphasis, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce and business process design. Of particular interest, is the development of ontologies and/or methods in the fields of enterprise engineering and enterprise architecture as it has been proven that many problems in software development occur due to incomplete specifications of an enterprise's needs, leading to a huge lack of success in software projects. It is then natural that one should strive to more fully capture and specify enterprise knowledge.\n\nKEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE TOPICS\n\n\n\nSemantic Web\nOntology Engineering\nOntology Matching and Alignment\nOntology Sharing and Reuse\nNatural Language Processing\nEnterprise Engineering\nDomain Ontologies\nApplications and Case-Studies\nDomain Analysis and Modeling\nEnterprise Ontology\nIntegration and Interoperability\nKnowledge Acquisition\nKnowledge Engineering\nKnowledge Representation\nOntology Tools\nReference Models\nFoundational Ontologies\nIC3K KEYNOTE SPEAKERS\nCarlo Sansone, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell'Informazione, University of Naples Federico II, Italy\nNirmalie Wiratunga, RGU's School of Computing, United Kingdom\nJoão Gama, University of Porto, Portugal\n\nPAPER SUBMISSION\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas.\n\nAuthors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics.
