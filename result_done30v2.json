    "CallForPaper": "PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, databases and constraint programming, and theorem proving.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nInnovative applications of declarative languages\nDeclarative domain-specific languages and applications\nPractical applications of theoretical results\nNew language developments and their impact on applications\nDeclarative languages and software engineering\nEvaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications\nPractical experiences and industrial applications\nNovel uses of declarative languages in the classroom\nPractical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages\n\nPADL 2024 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem proving methods that rely on declarative languages.\n\nSubmissions\n\nPADL 2024 welcomes three kinds of submission:\n\nTechnical papers (max. 15 pages): Technical papers must describe original, previously unpublished research results.\n\nApplication papers (max. 8 pages): Application papers are a mechanism to present important practical applications of declarative languages that occur in industry or in areas of research other than Computer Science. Application papers are expected to describe complex and/or real-world applications that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages. Application descriptions, engineering solutions and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are solicited.\n\nExtended abstracts (max. 3 pages): Describing new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.\n\nAll page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines\n\nThe review process of PADL 2024 is double-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgements that might identify you.\n\nAdditional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.\n\nPage numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:\n\n\\pagestyle{plain}\n\\usepackage{lineno}\n\\linenumbers \n\n\nThe conference proceedings of PADL 2024 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared.\n\nPapers should be submitted electronically at https://padl2024.hotcrp.com\n\nDistinguished Papers\n\nThe authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP). The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL."

A regular paper submission should not exceed 12 pages including title page and abstract, but excluding references and an optional appendix. Authors should include all necessary details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Any material (e.g., proofs or experimental results) omitted (from the main part of 12 pages) due to space limitations can be put into the optional appendix, which will be read at the Program Committee’s discretion. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings.\n\n(b) SHORT PAPER SUBMISSIONS: A short paper submission may present preliminary results or work-in-progress on a specific topic. Authors should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Authors should provide sufficient details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Short papers will be allotted upto 6 pages in the proceedings.\n\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nThe proceedings will be published on the Dagstuhl Open Access Seriesin Informatics (OASIcs) publication service.\n\nPROGRAM COMMITTEE\nPaul Bouman (co-chair), Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands\nDavid Coudert, INRIA and Université Côte d’Azur, France\nMattia D’Emidio, University of L’Aquila, Italy\nTwan Dollevoet, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands\nDaniele Frigioni, University of Aquila, Italy\nLoukas Georgiadis, University of Ioannina, Greece\nMarc Goerigk, University of Passau, Germany\nAndrew Goldberg, Amazon, USA\nVera Grafe, TU Kaiserslautern, Germany\nIrene Heinrich, TU Darmstadt, Germany\nSpyros Kontogiannis (co-chair), University of Patras, Greece\nJesper Larsen, Technical Universtity of Denmark, Denmark\nNiels Lindner, Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany\nPhiline Schiewe, Aalto University, Finland\nSabine Storandt, University of Konstanz, Germany\nRolf van Lieshout, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands\nSTEERING COMMITTEE\nAlberto Marchetti-Spaccamela, Sapienza Università di Roma, Italy\nMarie Schmidt, Universität Würzburg, Germany\nAnita Schöbel, University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, Germany\nChristos Zaroliagis, University of Patras, Greece (Chair)\nCONTACT\n\nAll questions about submissions should be emailed to the PC co-chairs:\n\nPaul Bouman: bouman _A T_ ese.eur.nl\nSpyros Kontogiannis: spyridon.kontogiannis _A T_ upatras.gr"

Therefore, the authors’ names, affiliations and bibliographic references should not be included in the version for evaluation by the Program Committee. This information should only be included in the camera-ready version, saved in Word or Latex format and also in PDF format. These files must be accompanied by the Consent to Publish form filled out, in a ZIP file, and uploaded at the conference management system.\n\nAll papers will be subjected to a “double-blind review” by at least two members of the Program Committee.\n\nBased on Program Committee evaluation, a paper can be rejected or accepted by the Conference Chairs. In the later case, it can be accepted as the type originally submitted or as another type. Thus, full papers can be accepted as short papers or poster papers only. Similarly, short papers can be accepted as poster papers only.\n\nPoster papers and Company papers are not published in the Conference Proceedings, being only presented and discussed. The authors of accepted poster papers should build and print a poster to be exhibited during the Conference. This poster must follow an A1 or A2 vertical format. The Conference includes Work Sessions where these posters are presented and orally discussed, with a 7 minute limit per poster.\n\nThe authors of accepted Full papers will have 15 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 5 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation. The authors of accepted Short papers and Company papers will have 11 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 4 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation.\n\nPublication and Indexing\n\nTo ensure that a full paper or short paper is published and presented, poster paper or company paper is presented, at least one of the authors must be fully registered by the 5th of January 2024, and the paper must comply with the suggested layout and page-limit. Additionally, all recommended changes must be addressed by the authors before they submit the camera-ready version.\n\nNo more than one paper per registration will be published. An extra fee must be paid for publication of additional papers, with a maximum of one additional paper per registration. One registration permits only the participation of one author in the conference.\n\nFull and Short papers will be published in Proceedings by Springer, in several books of of the Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series. Poster and company papers will not be published, just presented in the conference.\n\nPublished Full and Short papers will be submitted for indexation by WoS, SCOPUS, DBLP and Google Scholar, among others, and will be available in the SpringerLink Digital Library.\n\nThe authors of the best selected papers will be invited to extend them for publication in international journals indexed by WoS/SCI, SCOPUS and DBLP, among others, such as:\n\nInternational Journal of Neural Systems (IF: 8.0 / Q1)\nIntegrated Computer-Aided Engineering (IF: 6.5 / Q1)\nNeural Computing and Applications (IF: 6.0 / Q1)\nComputers & Security (IF. 5.6 / Q1)\nInformatica (IF: 2.9 / Q1)\nExpert Systems (IF: 3.3 / Q2)\nManagement Decision (IF: 4.6 / Q3)\nInternational Journal of Computers Communications & Control (IF: 2.7 / Q3)\nJournal of Computer Languages (IF: 2.2 / Q3)\nData Technologies and Applications (IF: 1.6 / Q4)\nComputer Science and Information Systems (IF: 1.4 / Q4)\nJournal of Engineering Research (IF: 1.1 / Q4)\n\nImportant Dates\n\nPaper Submission: November 17 30, 2023\nNotification of Acceptance: December 25, 2023\nPayment of Registration, to ensure the inclusion of an accepted paper in the conference proceedings: January 5, 2024.\nCamera-ready Submission: January 5, 2024"

    "CallForPaper": "ICSEA 2024: Call for Papers\nOnsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate a large number of situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos).\n\nThe International Conference on Software Engineering Advances (ICSEA 2024) continues a series of events covering a broad spectrum of software-related topics. The conference covers fundamentals on designing, implementing, testing, validating and maintaining various kinds of software. Several tracks are proposed to treat the topics from theory to practice, in terms of methodologies, design, implementation, testing, use cases, tools, and lessons learned. The conference topics cover classical and advanced methodologies, open source, agile software, as well as software deployment and software economics and education.\n\nOther advanced aspects are related to on-time practical aspects, such as run-time vulnerability checking, rejuvenation process, updates partial or temporary feature deprecation, software deployment and configuration, and on-line software updates. These aspects trigger implications related to patenting, licensing, engineering education, new ways for software adoption and improvement, and ultimately, to software knowledge management.\n\nThere are many advanced applications requiring robust, safe, and secure software: disaster recovery applications, vehicular systems, biomedical-related software, biometrics related software, mission critical software, E-health related software, crisis-situation software. These applications require appropriate software engineering techniques, metrics and formalisms, such as, software reuse, appropriate software quality metrics, composition and integration, consistency checking, model checking, provers and reasoning.\n\nThe nature of research in software varies slightly with the specific discipline researchers work in, yet there is much common ground and room for a sharing of best practice, frameworks, tools, languages and methodologies. Despite the number of experts we have available, little work is done at the meta level, that is examining how we go about our research, and how this process can be improved. There are questions related to the choice of programming language, IDEs and documentation styles and standard. Reuse can be of great benefit to research projects, yet reuse of prior research projects introduces special problems that need to be mitigated. The research environment is a mix of creativity and systematic approach which leads to a creative tension that needs to be managed or at least monitored. Much of the coding in any university is undertaken by research students or young researchers. Issues of skills training, development and quality control can have significant effects on an entire department. In an industrial research setting the environment is not quite that of industry as a whole, nor does it follow the pattern set by the university. The unique approaches and issues of industrial research may hold lessons for researchers in other domains.\n\nWe solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.\n\nIndustrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status.\n\nTutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged.\n\nThe topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas.\n\nAll topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.\n\nICSEA 2024 conference tracks:\n\nTrends and achievements\n\nAdvanced agile software development;

    "CallForPaper": "UMAP 2024 will adopt registration and presentation policies that must be followed by the authors of each accepted contribution. We invite prospective authors to carefully check them in the call before submitting. Any inquiries can be directed to umap2024-chair@um.org.\n\nThe 32nd International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2024) is the premier international conference for researchers and practitioners working on systems that adapt to individual users or groups of users, and that collect, represent, and model user information. ACM UMAP 2024 is sponsored by ACM SIGCHI and SIGWEB. User Modeling Inc., as the core Steering Committee, oversees the conference organization. ACM UMAP operates under the ACM Conference Code of Conduct. The main conference proceedings, published by ACM, will be part of the ACM Digital Library.\n\nThe theme of ACM UMAP 2024 is “Collaboration and Cooperation for the Greater Good“. Specifically, we welcome submissions that highlight the impact that working together and synergy (such as between academia, industry, influential policy making bodies, committees and communities) can have on solving the world’s biggest problems; the focus is on investigations that capture how user modeling, personalization, and adaptation of (intelligent) systems, also with the use of large language models and generative AI, may influence user behavior, trustful processes and whether new models are required, for building sustainable and inclusive services and solutions that can address critical challenges of our world.\n\nWhile we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only. As always, contributions from academia, industry, and other organizations discussing open challenges or novel research approaches are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to claims (e.g., user study, system evaluation, computational analysis).\n\nImportant Dates \nPaper Abstract Submission:\n\nJanuary 22, 2024 (mandatory)\n\nPaper Submission:\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nNotification:\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nCamera-ready Submission (TAPS system):\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\nConference:\n\nJuly 1 – 4, 2024\n\nNote: the submissions deadlines are at 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth) time.\n\nConference Tracks \n\nBelow you will find a detailed description of the focus of each conference track, as well as possible topics of interest associated with each track.\n\nPersonalized Recommender Systems\nCataldo Musto\n\nUniversity of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Italy\n\nDimitris Sacharidis\n\nUniversité Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium\n\nEva Zangerle\n\nUniversity of Innsbruck, Austria\n\nPersonalized, computer-generated recommendations have become a pervasive feature of today’s online world. From the traditional book and movie recommendations to suggestions of what we should eat and wear or where we should travel, recommender systems are seamlessly embedded in our daily lives. The underlying recommender systems are designed to help users and providers in a number of ways. From a user’s viewpoint, these systems assist humans by identifying relevant items or options (e.g., products, services, news articles, connections) within large collections. From a provider’s perspective, recommender systems have shown to be powerful tools to help users sift through massive information and steer consumer behavior. Regardless of who are the main stakeholders, the design of recommender systems requires careful consideration of various aspects, including the choice of the user modeling approach, the recommendation algorithm itself, and the user interface.\n\nRead More\nKnowledge Graphs, Semantics, Social and Adaptive Web\nDanilo Dessì\n\nKTS – GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Science, Germany\n\nElisabeth Lex\n\nGraz University of Technology, Austria\n\nPasquale Lops\n\nUniversity of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Italy\n\nThe use of graphs recently emerged as a natural and straightforward fashion to effectively model a broad range of phenomena and scenarios, ranging from the relationships in a social network to the elements encoded in a knowledge base, without forgetting their applications related to bioinformatics, web page searching, transportation, and navigation. \n\nResearch in the area of graphs typically includes: (i) schema design to represent data which will be modeled in the form of a graph; (ii) adding semantics to properties to the schema types and edges to make data meaningful and transform it into information (iii) reasoning over a graph to produce new information hidden behind the data; (iv) exploiting the information encoded in the graph for specific applications and use cases. All these aspects have triggered several heterogeneous research lines, that in turn significantly impacted user modeling, adaptation, and personalization.\n\nAs an example, the recent rise of knowledge graphs such as DBpedia and Wikidata has fueled the research in the area of adaptive web and personalized applications (e.g., recommender systems) by providing new and meaningful data points to model and represent all the actors (items, users, etc.) involved in the personalization process.\n\nRead More\nIntelligent User Interfaces\nAntonija Tanja Mitrovic\n\nUniversity of Canterbury, New Zealand\n\nLadislav Peška\n\nCharles University, Czechia\n\nBen Steichen\n\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, USA\n\nUser modeling allows systems to provide personalized support to humans, unlocking a potential to accomplish a wider range of tasks and/or make their existing tasks more efficient and/or convenient. While such systems are envisioned to seamlessly complement human abilities, research shows that humans do not always make the best possible decisions when working together with computer systems. Intelligent user interfaces aim to make the interaction between computer systems and humans smarter, more usable, more efficient, and more effective.\n\nTypically, papers in this track explore the design, implementation, and evaluation of personalized/intelligent user-facing systems, interfaces, and interaction mechanisms. By designing and deploying improved forms of support for interactive collaboration between human decision makers and personalized systems, intelligent user interfaces enable decision making processes that better leverage the strengths of both collaborators. Beyond user modeling and personalization, papers in this track are encouraged to leverage solutions from human-computer interaction, data mining, natural language processing, information visualization, and/or knowledge representation and reasoning.\n\nRead More\nPersonalizing Learning Experiences through User Modeling\nElla Haig\n\nUniversity of Portsmouth, UK\n\nRoberto Martinez-Maldonado\n\nMonash University, Australia\n\nSherry Sahebi\n\nUniversity at Albany-SUNY, USA\n\nTechnology has become an integral aspect of the everyday practices of learning. Navigating the streams of information, acquiring new skills and competences, and developing knowledge ‘on the go’ in formal education, personal study, workplaces, personal development, and health, are increasingly valued and necessary. In fact, technological innovations bring new opportunities to support learners’ needs, to orchestrate and enable personalized learning solutions, feedback processes, learner-learner collaboration, social learning, and learner-algorithm interaction, with and without the involvement of the teacher. This opens up opportunities for innovation by modeling the cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, affective, social, and psychomotor aspects of learning that can improve the effectiveness of personalized learning experiences for learning progress and learner/teacher satisfaction.\n\nRead More\nFairness, Transparency, Accountability, and Privacy\nVito Walter Anelli\n\nPolytechnic University of Bari, Italy\n\nMaria Bielikova\n\nKempelen Institute of Intelligent Technologies, Slovakia\n\nDietmar Jannach\n\nUniversity of Klagenfurt, Austria\n\nResearchers and developers have a social responsibility to care about the impact of their technologies on individual people (users, providers, and other stakeholders) and on society. This involves building, maintaining, evaluating, and studying adaptive systems that are fair, ethical, beneficial to society, and in line with universal human rights. The importance of these topics is highlighted by their presence in ethical guidelines such as the ACM Code of Ethics, policy guidelines such as UNESCO’s Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence, as well as their influence on law and regulation such as the EU’s GDPR and the proposed AI Act.\n\nFollowing these developments, the track on “Fairness, Transparency, Accountability, and Privacy” seeks contributions dealing with ethical and social matters of adaptive and recommendation systems, such as fairness and privacy, as well as works addressing compliance with policies and regulations, such as requirements for transparency, accountability, and protection of sensitive data. The research trends in Generative AI, e.g. in Large Language Models (LLM), frequently overlook aspects related to Fairness and Trust. The track seeks studies that delve into the transparency, trustworthiness, fairness, and privacy of these systems, and those aimed at developing methods for LLMs to selectively forget certain information to respect the user/stakeholders needs.\n\nRead More\nPersonalization for Persuasive and Behavior Change Systems\nFederica Cena\n\nUniversity of Turin, Italy\n\nAlain Starke\n\nUniversity of Amsterdam, Netherlands\n\nJulita Vassileva\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan, Canada\n\nTo address various societal problems, changing human behavior is crucial. Persuasive and Behaviour change systems are intentionally designed to support people to achieve behavior change objectives. Research in this area has advanced over the years attracting interest from both practitioners and researchers due to the increasing realization of the important role interactive technologies can play in assisting and motivating people to achieve their various goals and objectives.\n\nPersuasive and behavior change systems have applications in various domains including health and wellness, safety and security, environmental sustainability, education, and politics. For their personalization, persuasive and behavior change systems adapt and tailor the presented content or the decision context to increase their relevance, motivational appeal, or to enhance the user experience. The overall aim is to empower or assist people to achieve their goals, by exploiting user models and adapting systems. However, the persuasive use of personalizations on today’s large platforms or digital technologies is causing increasing concerns about behavior engineering that may harm users’ digital wellbeing, privacy  or autonomy. Personalized persuasive technology can be used to change user behaviour for unethical and exploitative purposes, for example, to achieve higher monetization in game design. Despite the recent advances, research in this area, where technology and theory should meet, is generally still in its infancy. \n\nRead More\nVirtual Assistants, Conversational Interactions, and Personalized Human-Robot Interaction\nBerardina Nadja De Carolis\n\nUniversity of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Italy\n\nFedelucio Narducci\n\nPolytechnic University of Bari, Italy\n\nSilvia Rossi\n\nUniversity of Naples Federico II, Italy\n\nVirtual assistants and conversational agents are being employed to support information search and exploration, as well as to mediate interaction with users. Human-robot interaction is also increasingly attracting attention as a new model to support user activity and empowerment, with particular attention to people with physical impairments, who can benefit from assistance during the execution of tasks. People may also be able to benefit from companionship provided by virtual assistants and robots. In both contexts, personalization is a key element to support the adaptation of an agent to personal interests, idiosyncrasies, and needs.\n\nRead More\nResearch Methods and Reproducibility\nAlejandro Bellogin\n\nUniversidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain\n\nHui Fang\n\nShanghai University of Finance and Economics, China\n\nAlan Said\n\nUniversity of Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nResearch on user modeling and adaptive systems has greatly evolved during the last decades, but important challenges remain regarding the systematic comparison of different systems, the development of universally accepted and applied methodologies, and the use of standardized metrics to evaluate the acceptability and usefulness of systems to the user.\n\nThis track invites submissions on how research methods should be applied to personalized systems, in particular, when running benchmarks and measurement scales, with particular attention to the reproducibility of results and techniques. Furthermore, the track looks for submissions reporting new insights from reproducing and/or replicating existing works.\n\nRead More\nSubmission \n\nAll submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system, https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap24, by selecting the “UMAP24 Full and Short Papers” track.\n\nLength and Formatting \n\nFormat. We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM new single-column format.\n\nLong papers (14 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value. They should reflect more complex innovations or studies and should have a more thorough discussion of related work. Each accepted long paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented in a plenary session as part of the main conference program.\nShort papers (7 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper – they are not “work-in-progress” reports but rather complete reports on a smaller or simpler-to-describe but complete research work on advances that can be described, set into context, and evaluated concisely. In particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance to this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental validation or lacking strong theoretical foundation. Each accepted short paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented either as an oral presentation or at a poster session as part of the main conference program.\n\nWe recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.\n\nAnonymity. Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ own prior work should be made in the third person. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection.\n\nTemplates. Following the ACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the new ACM single-column format. Instructions for authors are given below:\n\nLaTeX (use \\documentclass[manuscript, review, anonymous]{acmart} in the sample-authordraft.tex file for single-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for preparing your article with LaTeX.\nOverleaf (use \\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} for single-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for preparing your article with Overleaf.\nWord. Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for preparing your article with Microsoft Word\n\nShould you have any questions or issues going through the instructions above, please contact support at acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com for LaTeX and Microsoft Word inquiries.\n\nAccessibility. Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. The descriptive text will be displayed in place of a float if the float cannot be loaded. This benefits the author and it broadens the reader base for the author’s work. Moreover, the alt text provides in-depth float descriptions to search engine crawlers, which helps to properly index these floats. Additionally, authors should follow the ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures.\n\nSubmission Policy. All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy, which is why submitted manuscripts should not be currently under review at another publication venue. Particularly, please consider the following ACM’s publication policies:\n\n“By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.”\n“Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.”\nContent Expectations \n\nOriginality and Significance. Papers should report on original and substantial contributions of lasting value. Described work should concern the theory and/or practice of UMAP. Moreover, papers showcasing the innovative use of UMAP and exploring the benefits and challenges of applying UMAP technology in real-life applications and contexts are welcome.\n\nCommisurated evaluation. Evaluations of proposed solutions/applications must be commensurate with the claims made in the paper. Depending on the intended contribution, this may include simulation studies, offline evaluations, A/B tests, or controlled user experiments.\n\nReproducibility. Research procedures and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure scrutiny and reproducibility. We recognize that user data may be proprietary or confidential, but we encourage the sharing of (anonymized, cleaned) data sets, data collection procedures, and code.\n\nDiscussion and Implications. Results should be clearly communicated and implications of the contributions/findings for UMAP and beyond should be explicitly discussed.\n\nEthical & Human Subjects Considerations \n\nACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.\n\nReview Process & Camera-ready Submission \n\nReview. ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ prior work should be in the third person. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.\n\nReviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field. Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on whether the length is appropriate for the contribution. In addition, ACM UMAP 2024 will introduce a new “Raise Your Voice” stage during evaluation, offering a small window to authors to optionally discuss the initial decision of their submission, enhancing the transparency and quality of the reviewing process.\n\nThe ACM Code of Ethics gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Further, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection.\n\nCamera-ready Information. Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting. Users of the Word template must use either the version for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats such as Open Office, etc., are not admitted) for the camera-ready submission to avoid incompatibility issues.\n\nInstructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided after acceptance. This might include instructions to prepare a video of the accepted contribution. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be later submitted using ACM’s new production platform where authors will be able to review PDF and HTML output formats before publication.\n\nRegistration and Presentation Policy \n\nEach accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off. Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM and available via the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of UMAP 2024. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\nProgram Chairs \nPanagiotis Germanakos, SAP SE, Germany\nElvira Popescu, University of Craiova, Romania\n\nContact information: umap2024-program at um.org"
