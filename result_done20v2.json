    "CallForPaper": "ICALP 2024\n51st EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming\n\nICALP is the main conference and annual meeting of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS). ICALP 2024 will be preceded by a series of workshops, which will take place on July 7, 2024.\n\nICALP 2024 is organized by the Department of Software Science, Tallinn University of Technology, in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).\n\nThe first ICALP conference was organized in 1972. For more information about previous editions, see the EATCS webpage http://eatcs.org/index.php/international-colloquium.\n\nImportant dates\nSubmissions: February 14, 2024 at 1pm CET\nRebuttal: March 26-29, 2024\nAuthor notification: April 14, 2024\nCamera-ready version: April 28, 2024\nEarly registration: May 17, 2024\nConference: July 8-12, 2024\nICALP Workshops: July 6-7, 2024\nSubmissions\n\nPaper submissions are handled via Easychair.\n\n1) Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.\n\n2) Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The use of the LIPIcs document class is an option, but not required. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be verified.\n\n3) Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).\n\nThe purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.\n\n4) Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed.\n\n5) The submissions are done via Easychair to the appropriate track of the conference (see topics below). The use of pdflatex or similar pdf generating tools is mandatory and the page limit is strict (see point 2.) Papers that deviate significantly from these requirements risk rejection without consideration of merit.\n\n6) During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 26-29, 2024 to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.\n\n7) At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.\n\n8) Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.\n\nSafeToC\n\nICALP has joined http://safetoc.org.\n\nParticipants have to follow the ICALP code of conduct.\n\nThe ICALP 2024 SafeToc advocate is Diana Kessler."

    "CallForPaper": "The 34th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024) will take place in Banff, Alberta (Canada), June 1-6, 2024. ICAPS 2024 is a part of the ICAPS conference series, the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent planning and scheduling technology.\n\nTraditionally, ICAPS has had both a main track and a set of specialized tracks (e.g., Robotics, Applications, etc.) that authors could submit to, all mutually exclusive. This year, we will have a single main track, with former track themes replaced by a set of optional primary keywords that distinguish papers for differential review within the main track. These optional keywords will be in addition to the standard keywords we use every year. The purpose of these primary keywords is to enable submissions to self-identify research themes, support the identification of suitable reviewers, and potentially aid in the grouping of thematically related accepted papers in the conference program. Authors (resp. reviewers) will be able to optionally select one or more primary keywords to reflect best the thematic contributions of the paper (resp. reviewer expertise). Many authors will not avail themselves of these optional primary keywords.\n\nPrimary Keywords\nApplications\nLearning\nRobotics\nTheory\nHuman-aware Planning and Scheduling\nTemporal Planning\nMulti-Agent Planning\nKnowledge Representation/Engineering\n\nA short description of each primary keyword and expectations of papers/reviewers associated with them is provided below. Additionally, the ICAPS program will include a journal track, demonstrations, workshops, and tutorials, each having separate submission and notification dates, to be announced separately.\n\nThe ICAPS 2024 program committee invites paper submissions related to automated planning and scheduling. Relevant contributions include but are not limited to:\n\nTheoretical foundations of planning and scheduling\nClassical planning techniques and analysis\nKnowledge representation for planning and scheduling\nPlanning with time and resources\nPlan and schedule execution, monitoring, and repair\nContinual, on-line, and real-time planning and scheduling\nPlan recognition, plan management, and goal reasoning\nUncertainty and stochasticity in planning and scheduling\nPartially observable and unobservable domains\nConformant, contingent, and adversarial planning\nMulti-agent and distributed planning\nPlanning and scheduling with continuous state and action spaces\nPlanning and scheduling with mixed continuous and discrete states/actions/decisions\nRobot planning and scheduling\nKnowledge acquisition and engineering for planning and scheduling\nApplications and case studies of planning and scheduling techniques\nLearning for planning and scheduling\nHuman-aware planning and scheduling\nAuthor Guidelines\n\nAuthors may submit technical papers or position papers. Technical papers are expected to report on substantial original research, while position papers are expected to discuss ideas and concepts, for instance, via thoughtful critiques or bold new perspectives of the field, historical perspectives and analysis, or technical discussions of various implementation techniques. Both technical and position papers can be long (8 pages AAAI style plus up to one page of references) or short (4 pages plus up to one page of references). The type of paper must be indicated at submission time. All papers, regardless of length, will be reviewed against standard criteria such as relevance, originality, significance, clarity, and soundness and are expected to meet the same high standards set by ICAPS. Short papers may be of narrower scope, for example, by addressing a highly specific issue or proposing or evaluating a small, yet important, extension of previous work or new idea. Over-length papers will be rejected without review.\n\nAuthors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant, unique content. Papers submitted to ICAPS 2024 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2024 review period, nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.\n\nWe expect for ICAPS 2024 to be an in-person conference – one author of all accepted papers will be expected to present work in person unless there are exceptional circumstances that prevent this.\n\nUse of ChatGPT or similar LLMs\n\nICAPS 2024 is adopting the AAAI policy regarding the use of ChatGPT and similar large-scale language models (LLMs). Papers that include text generated from an LLM, such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note that this policy does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text.\n\nICAPS 2024 furthermore follows AAAI policy in that any AI system, including Generative Models such as Chat-GPT, BARD, or DALL-E, does not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI Press (ICAPS’ publisher) and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by AAAI press. Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.\n\nBest paper fast-track to top AI journals\n\nFollowing the ICAPS tradition, in ICAPS 2024, we will give awards to the best paper and best student paper. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal (e.g., the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ)).\n\nEthical/Societal Impact\n\nIt is optional for authors to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement can be included in either the main body pages or the reference page. If such a statement is not included in the paper, but the reviewers deem that such a statement is necessary, then the authors will be asked to provide one during the author response period for review. If the paper is accepted, the statement provided will need to be incorporated into the camera-ready version.\n\nSubmission Instructions\n\nAll submissions will be made electronically via OpenReview.\n\nSubmission Site\n\nDetails on what the review form will look like will be publicly released soon.\n\nSubmitted papers should be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, adhere to the page limits of the relevant submission type (long or short), and follow the author kit instructions for formatting. A custom author kit for ICAPS 2024, based on the AAAI 2024 template can be found here:\n\nZIP archive\nOverLeaf Template\n\nIn addition to the submitted PDF paper, authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) for their paper. Please make sure that the supporting material is also anonymized. Papers should be self-contained; reviewers are encouraged, but not obligated, to consider supporting material in their decisions.\n\nImportant Dates\n\nWe have arranged our schedule to allow for the revision and resubmission of papers rejected from AAAI 2024.\n\nDecember 7, 2023 - Abstracts due (electronic submission)\nDecember 13, 2023 - Full papers due (electronic submission, PDF)\nJanuary 24-27, 2024 - Author feedback period\nFebruary 12, 2024 - Notification of acceptance or rejection\n\nThe reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, as long as there is still some place anywhere in the world where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time!\n\nICAPS 2023 Program Chairs\nSara Bernardini, Royal Holloway University of London, UK\nChristian Muise, Queen’s University, Canada\n\nFor inquiries contact: program@icaps2024.com\n\nFAQ\nWhat will be made public from the review process?\n\nThe anonymized reviews, and final rebuttals from authors, will be made public on just those papers accepted. This will happen after the notification of acceptance/rejection. No discussion between reviewers and SPC will be made public, and reviewers/SPC will not be identified.\n\nAren’t you revealing too much?\n\nWe do not believe so. The reviews are already anonymized, and the rebuttals are written by the authors. We believe that the community will benefit from seeing the reviews and rebuttals, and that this will help improve the quality of the reviews in the long term.\n\nAren’t you revealing too little?\n\nHistorically, ICAPS has not made any part of the review process public. We believe that this is a good first step towards making the review process more transparent, and we will continue to evaluate what else can be made public in the future.\n\nAren’t the last two questions contradictory?\n\nYes, and we’ve been asked versions of both by severeal members of the community!\n\nCan papers be revised while under review?\n\nNo, papers cannot be revised while under review. The author feedback period is for authors to respond to the reviews, not to revise their papers. There will be an opportunity to revise papers after the notification of acceptance/rejection before the camera-ready copy is due.\n\nIs the rebuttal interactive/threaded?\n\nNo, the rebuttal is not interactive. Authors will be able to submit a single rebuttal to each review separately, and reviewers will be able to submit a single review. There will be no back-and-forth between authors and reviewers for this year.\n\nWhat is the policy on uploading our submissions to arXiv?\n\nYes, following the AAAI policy, you are allowed to upload your submissions to arXiv during the review period.\n\nCan rejected AAAI papers be submitted? The AAAI notification is after abstract submission.\n\nWe consider it a full submission only when you submit the full paper. So, yes, please do submit your abstract and withdraw the submission if it happens to be accepted to AAAI. If, for whatever reason, AAAI pushes back the notification beyond our paper submission deadline, we will reconsider that date.\n\nMust I select a primary keyword?\n\nNo. We fully expect there to be several papers without a primary keyword selection. Only select primary keyword(s) if they make sense for your work.\n\nWhat will the review form look like?\n\nYou can find a draft of the form questions reviewers will use [here].\n\nCan we use more than a page of references if we use fewer than 8 pages of content?\n\nYes, you can use up to 9 pages total (5 pages for short papers), as long as the final page contains only references. This means that you may have 7.5 pages of content and 1.5 pages of references, for example.\n\nIs there any exception to the limit of references?\n\nWe may grant specific exceptions to authors in situations such as a survey paper, where the broad list of references are a key part of the paper itself. Please contact the program chairs if you believe you have a special case.\n\nHow do we register conflicts?\n\nThis will come in two places. First, on your profile page, you can select conflicts to individuals (e.g., key advisors, collaborators, etc) – the link can be found [here]. Second, reviewers and SPC should be able to flag papers as conflicts during the bidding process. Some conflicts (e.g., papers where a reviewer is also an author) should be automatically registered.\n\nPrimary Keyword Descriptions\nApplications\n\nThe goal of the “Applications” focus is to bring together planning and scheduling practitioners, industry stakeholders and academic communities for exchanging all aspects of the development, deployment, and evaluation of planning and scheduling systems for societal or industrial problems. We aim to bring scientific results from planning and scheduling to practice but also aim to identify scientific challenges by analyzing the limitations of current results to tackle real-world problems. We solicit participation from industry practitioners as well as from academics working on applications.\n\nLearning\n\nThe aim of the “Learning” primary keyword is to identify papers that are at the intersection of machine or reinforcement learning on one hand and planning & scheduling on the other. Neurosymbolic approaches, data-driven domain or scheduling constraint learning, application of scheduling or planning to learning systems, etc., are all examples of this area. If relevant, authors are expected to use appropriate ML/RL methodology (e.g., train/validation/test splits, ablation studies, etc.), and reviewers will be expected to be well-versed in being able to assess the submitted works through this lens.\n\nRobotics\n\nThe “Robotics” primary keyword is to identify papers that revolve around the advancement of intelligent robots. Planning models and techniques are important for enabling autonomous, flexible, and interactive behaviours in robotic systems. A deep integration of these methods into robotic architectures can assist their effective deployment. Papers associated with this keyword would showcase the use of planning and scheduling technology in robotics applications. Examples of themes under this keyword are integrated task and motion planning, plan execution, failure detection and recovery, multi-robot planning, scheduling/coordination, execution, etc.\n\nTheory\n\nPapers that select the “Theory” keyword should contain novel contributions of a theoretical manner. Examples may include proving existing conjectures, introducing a novel proof technique, demonstrating novel complexity results, etc. Proving common properties of novel methods in otherwise core planning & scheduling techniques does not warrant the selection of “Theory” (e.g., showing the soundness/completeness of a new planning algorithm need not be flagged as “Theory”). Reviewers will be expected to be comfortable assessing the correctness and significance of theoretical contributions to the fields of planning & scheduling.\n\nHuman-Aware P&S\n\nThe “Human-Aware Planning and Scheduling” keyword refers to research contributions on planning, scheduling, and decision support systems that account for and fluidly interact with the humans in the loop. The keyword encompasses all works that look at tackling any challenges inherent to settings where a person needs to use, interact, collaborate or work along with planning and scheduling systems. Examples of themes under this keyword are plan and goal recognition, behavior prediction, mixed-initiative planning and scheduling systems, interpretability and explainability of AI planning/scheduling systems, trust, communication, and collaboration in human-AI teams, etc.\n\nTemporal Planning\n\nThe “Temporal Planning” keyword refers to planning formulations where multiple actions can be taken simultaneously, their durations may vary, and actions and events may have complex interdependencies determining which combinations are possible. The keyword includes formulations where temporal constraints are defined in terms of restrictions on the ways actions in plans can be sequenced or overlap and where objective functions inspired by Operations Research are required (makespan, tardiness, etc.) to be optimized.\n\nMulti-Agent Planning\n\nThe “Multi-Agent Planning” keyword refers to planning formulations where planning is performed by or for multiple agents. The keyword includes (but is not limited to) themes such as agents planning for a common goal, plan coordination/merging, plan negotiation, distributed planning and scheduling, real-time execution of multi-agent plans, multi-agent pathfinding, multi-agent epistemic planning, multi-agent systems, and applications of multi-agent systems.\n\nKnowledge Representation/Engineering\n\nThe “Knowledge Representation/Engineering’’ keyword refers to representing agents’ knowledge explicitly in a declarative form. The keyword includes (but is not limited to) work on reformulation of models and domain knowledge, languages to represent knowledge, acquisition and refinement of models, translation of models between different languages, and injecting knowledge to support the search process (i.e., domain control knowledge)."

    "CallForPaper": "SCOPE\n\nCOMPLEXIS – The International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk, aims at becoming a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing innovative views on all aspects of Complex Information Systems, in different areas such as Informatics, Telecommunications, Computational Intelligence, Biology, Biomedical Engineering and Social Sciences. Information is pervasive in many areas of human activity – perhaps all – and complexity is a characteristic of current Exabyte-sized, highly connected and hyper dimensional, information systems. COMPLEXIS is expected to provide an overview of the state of the art as well as upcoming trends, and to promote discussion about the potential of new methodologies, technologies and application areas of complex information systems, in the academic and corporate world.\nCOMPLEXIS seeks papers reporting research work, applications or case-studies, on topics indicated below in the section “Conference Areas”. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Both technological and social-oriented papers are accepted. All papers must describe original work, not previously published or submitted to another conference. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of COMPLEXIS under an ISBN, and will be indexed by major indexes.

    "CallForPaper":  "Twenty-First International Conference on Computability and Complexity in Analysis\nJuly 15-18, 2024, Swansea, UK\n\n\n\n\nScope\nThe conference is concerned with the theory of computability and complexity over real-valued data.\n\n\nComputability and complexity theory are two central areas of research in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. Computability theory is the study of the limitations and abilities of computers in principle. Computational complexity theory provides a framework for understanding the cost of solving computational problems, as measured by the requirement for resources such as time and space. The classical approach in these areas is to consider algorithms as operating on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. Such strings may represent various discrete objects such as integers or algebraic expressions, but cannot represent general real or complex numbers, unless they are rounded.\n\n\nMost mathematical models in physics and engineering, however, are based on the real number concept. Thus, a computability theory and a complexity theory over the real numbers and over more general continuous data structures is needed. Despite remarkable progress in recent years many important fundamental problems have not yet been studied, and presumably numerous unexpected and surprising results are waiting to be detected.\n\n\nScientists working in the area of computation on real-valued data come from different fields, such as theoretical computer science, domain theory, logic, constructive mathematics, computer arithmetic, numerical mathematics and all branches of analysis. The conference provides a unique opportunity for people from such diverse areas to meet, present work in progress and exchange ideas and knowledge.\n\n\nThe topics of interest include foundational work on various models and approaches for describing computability and complexity over the real numbers. They also include complexity-theoretic investigations, both foundational and with respect to concrete problems, and new implementations of exact real arithmetic, as well as further developments of already existing software packages. We hope to gain new insights into computability-theoretic aspects of various computational questions from physics and from other fields involving computations over the real numbers.\n\n\nTopics\nComputable analysis\nComplexity on real numbers\nComputable numbers, subsets and functions\nTheory of representations\nComputable differential equations\nRandomness and computable measure theory\nAlgorithmic fractal dimension\nEffective descriptive set theory\nWeihrauch complexity\nReverse analysis\nConstructive analysis\nDomain theory and analysis\nRealizability theory and analysis\nModels of computability on real numbers\nReal number algorithms\nExact real number arithmetic\nInvited Speakers\nDjamel Eddine Amir (Nancy, France)\nMatea Celar (Zagreb, Croatia)\nVittorio Cipriani (Vienna, Austria)\nTakayuki Kihara (Nagoya, Japan)\nEmmanuel Rauzy (Munich, Germany)\nMonika Seisenberger (Swansea, UK)\nScientific Programme Committee\nMartín Escardó (Birmingham, UK)\nJun Le Goh (Singapore)\nRupert Hölzl (Munich, Germany)\nZvonko Iljazović, chair (Zagreb, Croatia)\nAlexander Melnikov (Wellington, New Zealand)\nAnton Setzer (Swansea, UK)\nHolger Thies (Kyoto, Japan)\nNing Zhong (Cincinnati, USA)\nOrganizing Committee\nEike Neumann, chair (Swansea, UK)\nArno Pauly (Swansea, UK)\nOlga Petrovska (Swansea, UK)\nCécilia Pradic (Swansea, UK)\nManlio Valenti (Swansea, UK)\nFunding and Sponsoring\nFunding opportunities for student members of the Association for Symbolic Logic (ASL) are available.

    "CallForPaper":   "Calls\nFull Papers\n\nComputational Creativity (CC) is a discipline with its roots in scientific disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Engineering, Design, Psychology and Philosophy that each explores the potential for computers to be creative – either in partnership with humans or as autonomous creators in their own right.\n\nICCC is an annual conference that welcomes papers on different aspects of CC, on systems that exhibit varying degrees of creative autonomy, on systems that act as creative partners for human creators, on frameworks that offer greater clarity or computational felicity for thinking about machine (and human) creativity, on methodologies for building or evaluating CC systems, on approaches to teaching CC in schools and universities or to promoting societal uptake of CC as a field and as a technology, and so on.\n\nImportant Dates\nTopics\nPaper Types\nPresentation\nSubmission Instructions\nCamera-Ready Submission Instructions\nTopics\n\nOriginal research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:\n\nDomain-Specific Applications of Computational Creativity: applications of creativity in areas such as music, language, narrative, poetry, games, visual arts, graphic design, product design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, or programming.\nGenerative AI Models of Creativity: extensions or modifications of generative AI algorithms that provide new capabilities, new metrics, or improved utility in creative contexts.\nHuman-Machine Co-Creativity: Systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, with emphasis on systems in which the machine acts as a creative partner.\nComputational Creativity Evaluation: Metrics, frameworks, formalisms and methodologies for the evaluation of creativity in computational systems, or for the evaluation of how such systems are perceived in society.\nSocial Models: Computational models of social aspects of creativity, including: social creativity, the diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.\nComputational Paradigms: computational approaches for modelling cognitive aspects of creativity, such as heuristic search, analogical and meta-level reasoning, cognitive architectures, and re-representation.\nInterdisciplinary Perspectives: Perspectives on computational creativity which draw from philosophical and/or sociological studies in the context of creative AI systems.\nData and Creativity: Data science approaches to computational creativity: Resource development and data gathering/knowledge curation for creative AI. There is a need for datasets and resources that are scalable, extensible and freely available/open-source.\nSocietal Impact: Ethical considerations in the design, deployment or testing of creative AI systems, as well as studies that explore the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.\nPsychological Factors: Computational models of psychological factors that enhance creativity, including emotion, surprise (unexpectedness), reflection, conflict, diversity, motivation, knowledge, intuition, reward structures. Additionally, social or experiential factors related to novelty and originality, such as innovation, improvisation, and virtuosity.\nProvocations: Raising new issues not on this list that bring the foundations of the discipline into question or throw new light on seemingly settled debates.\n\n \n\nPaper Types\n\nWe welcome the submission of five different types of long papers, each with the intent to approach an equal distribution of accepted papers. During your submission, please indicate the category by which your paper best fits into:\n\nTechnical papers: These are papers posing and addressing hypotheses about aspects of creative behaviour in computational systems. The emphasis here is on using solid experimentation, computational models, formal proof, and/or argumentation that clearly demonstrates advancement in the state of the art or current thinking in CC research. Strong evaluation of approaches through comparative, statistical, social, or other means is essential.\nSystem or Resource description papers: These are papers describing the building and deployment of a creative system or resource to produce artefacts of potential cultural value in one or more domains. The emphasis here is on presenting engineering achievement, technical difficulties encountered and overcome, techniques employed, reusable resources built, and general findings about how to get computational systems to produce valuable results. Presentation of results from the system or resource is expected. While full evaluation of the approaches employed is not essential if the technical achievement is very high, some evaluation is expected to show the contribution to CC of this work.\nStudy papers: These are papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, humanities, the arts, and so on; or which appeal to broader areas of AI and Computer Science in general; or which appeal to studies of the field of CC as a whole. The emphasis here is on presenting enlightening novel perspectives related to the building, assessment, or deployment of systems ranging from autonomously creative systems to creativity support tools. Such perspectives can be presented through a variety of approaches including ethnographic studies, thought experiments, comparisons with studies of human creativity, and surveys. The contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear in every case.\nCultural application papers: These are papers presenting the use of creative software in a cultural setting, for example via art exhibitions/books, concerts/recordings/scores, poetry or story readings/anthologies, cookery nights/books, results for scientific journals or scientific practice, released games/game jam entries, and so on. The emphasis here is on a clear description of the role of the system in the given context, the results of the system in the setting, technical details of inclusion of the system, and evaluative feedback from the experience garnered from public audiences, critics, experts, stakeholders, and other interested parties.\nPosition papers: These are papers presenting an opinion on some aspect of the culture of CC research, including discussions of future directions, speculative explorations of the impact of state-of-the-art approaches, past triumphs or mistakes, and current issues. The emphasis here is on carefully arguing a position; highlighting or exposing previously hidden or misunderstood issues or ideas; and providing thought leadership for the field, either in a general fashion or in a specific setting. While opinions need not be substantiated through formalization or experimentation, any justification of a point of view will need to draw on a thorough knowledge of the field of CC and of overlapping areas, and provide relevant motivations and arguments.\n\nICCC is a conference that emphasises the empirical and theoretical evaluation of technical systems, results and outcomes, in an ethical and scientific fashion. Evaluation is expected in Technical papers (strong evaluation) and in System or Resource description papers. Although evaluation is not required in other types of papers, the contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed in terms of quality, impact, and relevance to the area of Computational Creativity.\n\n \n\nPresentation\n\nIn order to ensure the highest level of quality, all submissions will be evaluated in terms of their scientific, technical, artistic, and/or cultural contribution, and therefore there will be only one format for submission. The program committee will decide the best format for presenting accepted manuscripts in the conference.\n\nTo be included in the proceedings, each paper must be presented at the conference by one of the authors. This implies that at least one author will have to register and will have to participate live in the session in which their paper is presented, including the designated question-and-answer period.\n\n*** All authors of accepted papers can opt to also show a demo of their system or prototype during the conference. You will be asked if you are interested in this option during the submission process ***\n\n \n\nSubmission instructions\n\nThis year the submission process has two stages: initial submission of a title and abstract, and subsequent submission of the full paper a week later.\n\nRecommended length for the abstract is 100-200 words.\nThe long paper page limit is 8 pages + up to 2 pages of references.\nPapers will be reviewed in a double-blind fashion, which necessitates that authors take appropriate steps to remain anonymous.\nYou are responsible for making your papers anonymous to allow for double-blind review. Remove all references to your home institution(s), refer to your past work in the third person, etc.\nTo be considered, papers must be submitted as a PDF document formatted according to ICCC style (which is similar to AAAI and IJCAI formats). You can download the updated ICCC’24 LaTeX template [here] and Word template [here].\nAbstracts are to be returned one week before the full paper deadline. Submit your abstract via the Easy Chair system. You are required to fill out authors, a title, abstract and keywords. You can include the same information in a pdf.\nSubmit your full paper by updating the EasyChair Abstract with your manuscript file. Abstract submissions that do not contain a manuscript will be automatically rejected at the beginning of the review time.\nPapers must be submitted through the EasyChair platform: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccc24\nDouble submissions policy: The work submitted to ICCC should not be under review in another scientific conference or journal at the time of submission.\n\n \n\nCamera-Ready Submission Instructions\n\nTo submit the camera-ready version, login in EasyChair platform, select your paper, click “update file” and upload the camera-ready version of your paper.\nPlease bear in mind that:\n\nPapers should be no more than 8 page sides in length + 2 pages of references.\nTo be considered, papers must be submitted as a PDF document formatted according to ICCC style (which is similar to AAAI and IJCAI formats). You can download the updated ICCC’24 LaTeX template [here] and Word template [here].\nTo be included in the proceedings, each paper must be presented in the conference by one of the authors.\n\n "

Submissions are invited in five broad categories: (i) theories, algorithms, and models, (ii) NLP applications, (iii) language resources, (iv) NLP evaluation and (v) topics of general interest. Submissions that span multiple categories are particularly welcome.rence\n\n(I) Theories, algorithms, and models\nDiscourse and Pragmatics\nExplainability and Interpretability of Large Language Models\nLanguage Modeling\nCL/NLP and Linguistic Theories\nCL/NLP for Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\nMachine Learning for CL/NLP\nMorphology and Word Segmentation\nSemantics\nTagging, Chunking, Syntax and Parsing\nTextual Inference\n(II) NLP applications\nApplications (including BioNLP and eHealth, NLP for legal purposes, NLP for Social Media and Journalism, etc.)\nDialogue and Interactive Systems\nDocument Classification, Topic Modeling, Information Retrieval and Cross-Lingual Retrieval\nInformation Extraction, Text Mining, and Knowledge Graph Derivation from Texts\nMachine Translation for Spoken/Written/Sign Languages, and Translation Aids\nSentiment Analysis, Opinion and Argument Mining\nSpeech Recognition/Synthesis and Spoken Language Understanding\nNatural Language Generation, Summarization and Simplification\nQuestion Answering\nOffensive Speech Detection and Analysis\nVision, Robotics, Multimodal and Grounded Language Acquisition\n(III) NLanguage resource design, creation, and use: text, speech, sign, gesture, image, in single or multimodal/multimedia data\nGuidelines, standards, best practices and models for LRs, interoperability\nMethodologies and tools for LRs construction, annotation, and acquisition\nOntologies, terminology and knowledge representation\nLRs and Semantic Web (including Linked Data, Knowledge Graphs, etc.)\nLRs and Crowdsourcing\nMetadata for LRs and semantic/content mark-up\nLRs in systems and applications such as information extraction, information retrieval, audio-visual and multimedia search, speech dictation, meeting transcription, Computer-Aided Language Learning, training and education, mobile communication, machine translation, speech translation, summarisation, semantic search, text mining, inferencing, reasoning, sentiment analysis/opinion mining, (speech-based) dialogue systems, natural language and multimodal/multisensory interactions, chatbots, voice-activated services, etc.\nUse of (multilingual) LRs in various fields of application like e-government, e-participation, e-culture, e-health, mobile applications, digital humanities, social sciences, etc.\nLRs in the age of deep neural networks\nOpen, linked and shared data and tools, open and collaborative architectures\nBias in language resources\nUser needs, LT for accessibility\n(IV) NLP evaluation methodologies\nNLP evaluation methodologies, protocols and measures\nBenchmarking of systems and products\nEvaluation metrics in Machine Learning\nUsability evaluation of HLT-based user interfaces and dialogue systems\nUser satisfaction evaluation\n(V) Topics of general interest\nMultilingual issues, language coverage and diversity, less-resourced languages\nReplicability and reproducibility issues\nOrganisational, economical, ethical and legal issues\nPriorities, perspectives, strategies in national and international policies\nInternational and national activities, projects and initiatives\nLREC-COLING 2024 invites high-quality submissions written in English. Submissions of three forms of papers will be considered:\n\n \n\nA. Regular long papers – up to eight (8) pages maximum*, presenting substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work.\n\nB. Short papers – up to four (4) pages*, describing a small focused contribution, negative results, system demonstrations, etc.\n\nC. Position papers – up to eight (8) pages*, discussing key hot topics, challenges and open issues, as well as cross-fertilization between computational linguistics and other disciplines.\n\n* Excluding any number of additional pages for references, ethical consideration, conflict-of-interest, as well as data and code availability statements.\n\nAppendices or supplementary material will be allowed ONLY in the final, camera-ready version, but not during submission, as papers should be reviewed without the need to refer to any supplementary materials.\n\nLinguistic examples, if any, should be presented in the original language but also glossed into English to allow accessibility for a broader audience. \n\nNote that paper types are decisions made orthogonal to the eventual, final form of presentation (i.e., oral versus poster).\n\nAUTHOR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n \n\nPapers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized to support double-blind reviewing. Submissions thus must not include authors’ names and affiliations. The submissions should also avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.\n\nIf the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, LREC-COLING 2024 will follow the same policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.\n\nMore specifically, direct submissions to LREC-COLING 2024 may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after September 22, 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to submission time).\n\nAlso included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.\n\nPapers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at LREC-COLING 2024, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at LREC-COLING 2024 is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the LREC-COLING 2024 committee must be notified immediately.\n\nETHICS STATEMENT\n\n \n\nWe encourage all authors submitting to LREC-COLING 2024 to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of their work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).\n\nPRESENTATION REQUIREMENT\n\n \n\nAll papers accepted to the main conference track must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings, and at least one author must register for LREC-COLING2024.\n\nAll papers accepted to the main conference will be required to submit a presentation video. The conference will be hybrid, with an emphasis on encouraging interaction between the online and in-person modalities, and thus presentations can be either on-site or virtual.\n\nCONTACT\n\nConference website: https://lrec-coling-2024.lrec-conf.org/ \n\nEmail: contact@lrec-coling-2024.org\n\nTwitter: @LrecColing2024"

    "CallForPaper":   "Scope\n\nModern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, rchitectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.\n\nMain topics\n\nTopics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:\n\nTheoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.\nCoordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.\nCoordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.\nSession-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.\nModels, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.\nLanguages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination.\nCybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.\nNature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.\nSpecification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.\nDynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.\nCoordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.\nProgramming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.\nCoordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.\nIndustrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.\nInterdisciplinary aspects of coordination.\nKeynote speakers\nMarieke Huisman (University of Twente, The Netherlands)\nLaura Kovács (Vienna University of Technology, Austria)\nPaulo Veríssimo (KAUST, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia)\n"
