 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Final Call for Papers*
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Reversible Computation 2024*
======================================

 &nbsp; July 4th – 5th, Torun, Poland

| Scope&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
------------

Reversible computation has a growing number of promising application areas such as low power design, coding/decoding, debugging, testing and verification, database recovery, discrete event simulation, reversible algorithms, reversible specification formalisms, reversible programming languages, process algebras, and the modeling of biochemical systems.
Furthermore, reversible logic provides a basis for quantum computation with its applications, for example, in cryptography and in the development of highly efficient algorithms. First reversible circuits and quantum circuits have been implemented and are seen as promising alternatives to conventional CMOS technology.

The conference will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in Reversible Computation. This includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers, tutorials, tool demonstrations, and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference. Invited talks by leading international experts will complete the program.

Contributions on all areas of Reversible Computation are welcome, including — but not limited to — the following topics:
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Applications
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Architectures
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Algorithms
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Bidirectional transformations
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Circuit Design
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Debugging
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Fault Tolerance and Error Correction
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hardware
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Information Theory
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Physical Realizations
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Programming Languages
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Quantum Computation
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Software
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Synthesis
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Theoretical Results
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Testing
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Verification

-------------------

*Amr Sabry* is a Professor of Computer Science at Indiana University. His research interests are in the semantics, logical foundations, and implementations of programming languages. He has published on a range of themes including the typing, logical foundations, and programming applications of continuations and continuation-passing style, reasoning about monadic effects and staged computation, and programming language models of quantum computing. Together with Matthias Felleisen, Sabry wrote a series of papers on the use of continuations in the compilation of functional languages which includes one of the fifty most influential papers in the last twenty years of the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI). Together with Eugenio Moggi, Sabry gave what is considered the long-awaited definitive answer that monadic encapsulation of effects using rank-2 polymorphism is correct. His most recent research interests are related to quantum computing.

| How to Submit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
---------------------

To submit a paper to the Reversible Computation conference, please follow these guidelines:
You can submit
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Full research papers (16 pages maximum, including bibliography),
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Work-in-progress or tool demonstration papers (6 pages maximum, including bibliography).

The paper submission will be accepted as a PDF file using the LNCS style.

Authors are encouraged to include their ORCID's in the paper.
Author(s) of accepted papers are expected to participate in the conference and to present their papers. We would appreciate it if one person would not present more than two papers at the conference. If more than two papers are accepted by a group of authors, we kindly ask that the papers be presented by different co-authors, as far as possible. PC chairs and general chairs are not permitted to submit papers to the conference.
All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume.

Papers are to be submitted via
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rc2024.
