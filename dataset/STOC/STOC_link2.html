    <b>The 56th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2024)</b>,
      sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (<a href="http://www.sigact.org/">SIGACT</a>),
      will be held in Vancouver, Canada from <b>Monday, June 24</b> to <b>Friday, June 28</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of 
computation are sought. 
    Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and 
data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, 
algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean 
functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational 
learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and 
computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, 
algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, 
computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and 
computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine 
learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and 
computational biology.  
    Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise 
important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and 
analysis, are encouraged. 
    The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad 
range of areas.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Submission format:</b> 
      Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, <b>no author information (see below)</b>,
 and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's 
contributions.  
      There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the "full
 version" of their paper as the submission.
      Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages 
following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the 
paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the 
context of prior work and a description of the key technical and 
conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.
      This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad 
spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to 
experts in the subarea.  
      Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical 
claims of the paper to be fully verified.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material
 other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages 
will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to 
put the references at the very end of the submission. 
      The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, 
in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample 
spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x
 11 inch) paper.  Submissions deviating significantly from these 
guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>STOC 2024 will use double-blind reviewing</b>, and as such, 
submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. 
      In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses 
should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. 
      Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their 
own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related
 work are in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous 
work…" but rather "We build on the work of…").
      <br>
      <br>
      The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and
 external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without 
bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors
 are if they were to try.  (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of 
Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, as well
 as to a small set of COI-Management PC Members on an as-needed basis.)
      Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the 
submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. 
      In particular, important references should not be omitted or 
anonymized. 
      In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas 
or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. 
      For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, 
submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.
      <br>
      <br>
      All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be 
disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. 
      In addition, the program committee may consult with journal 
editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial 
issues such as parallel submissions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>PC Member Submissions:</b> Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Recommended Best practices for References:</b> 
        Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing 
for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for 
example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages.
        If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page 
immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the 
first ten pages. 
        <br>
        <br>
	      Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in favor of an 
equal mention of all authors' surnames. 
        If the number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ} 
show..." instead of "X et al. show". 
        Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric 
(e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first
 three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a
 numerical reference. 
        If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using 
\bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Conflict of Interest Policy:</b> 
      The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of 
interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. 
      This declared COI information can only be seen by the program 
committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program 
committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, the small set of 
COI-Management PC Members may see some of this information when 
assisting in managing COIs.)
      STOC 2024 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, 
which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (see <a href="http://safetoc.org/index.php/conflict-of-interest-sample-wording/">here</a>) and the ACM Conflict of Interest <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">policy</a>.
      Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Family member or close friend.</li>
      <li>Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.</li>
      <li>Person with the same affiliation.</li>
      <li>Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)</li>
      <li>Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).</li>
      <li>Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected
      within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work.</li>
    </ol>
      If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict
 of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any
 <a href="https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/">ToC advocate</a> 
affiliated with this conference directly.  
      Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of
 the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC 
advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict.  
      Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of 
the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit.  If 
authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a 
ToC advocate.  
    <p></p>

    <p><b>Submission Instructions:</b> 
      Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).
    </p>
    <p><b>The <a href="https://stoc24.hotcrp.com/">submission server</a> is scheduled to open on Oct. 6, 2023.</b>
    </p>

    <p>It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their 
full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a 
similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.
    </p>

    ACM is moving to require ORCIDs for all authors.
    An ORCID is an identifier that uniquely identifies an author.  
    It connects an author's work even if there are variations in the 
names used on different papers, ensuring that the author gets credit for
 all of their contributions.  
    Using ORCIDs will help ACM administer the ACM OPEN program where 
universities get open-access publishing via a subscription, aid in 
identifying conflicts of interests, and support other publications 
processes.  
    ORCIDs are easy to obtain; it takes less than a minute. 

    <p>
      <b>Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:</b> 
      The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication 
and simultaneous submissions. 
      Work that has been previously published in another conference 
proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to 
June 2024, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2024.  
      The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous 
publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals.  
      SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same 
(or essentially the same) material to another conference with published 
proceedings. 
      The program committee may consult with program chairs of other 
(past or future) conferences to find out about closely related 
submissions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Presentation of Accepted Papers:</b> 
      One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and
 present the work in the form of a talk at the conference.
      Authors are expected to contact the program chair before 
submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., 
international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from 
attending the conference.
Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.

      <b>Publication date:</b> 
      AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the 
proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.  This date 
may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.  The 
official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings 
related to published work.  (For those rare conferences whose
      proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the 
conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day 
of the conference.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Best Paper Award:</b> The program committee may designate up to
 three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers.   All 
submissions are automatically eligible.  In addition to the standard 
COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the 
subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference.  Rules for 
the award can be found at <a href="https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html">https://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:</b> A prize of $500 will 
be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split 
between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if 
all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To 
inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the 
appropriate box in the web form on the submission server.  The list of 
past winners can be found at
      <a href="https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html">https://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Access to Proceedings:</b> The committee intends to provide 
registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a 
password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks 
before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt 
out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee 
chair by March 19, 2024.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Student Travel Awards:</b> SIGACT provides travel awards to 
students without available support, and researchers from developing 
countries. More information on the award process will be posted later 
on.
