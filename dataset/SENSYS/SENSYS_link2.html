<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
</header>


<article class="post-content">
<p>The 22nd ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys 2024) 
	is the premier computer systems conference focused on the architecture, 
	design, implementation, and performance of networked sensing systems, 
	sensor-oriented data modeling and intelligence, and sensor-enabled applications. 
	ACM SenSys brings together academic, industry, and government professionals to a 
	single-track, highly selective forum that takes a broad view on the areas of 
	computing relevant to the future of networked embedded sensor systems. 
	Topics of interests include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>New platforms and hardware designs for networked sensor systems</li>
	<li>New communication paradigms for ubiquitous connectivity</li>
	<li>Low-power wireless media access control, network, and transport protocol designs</li>
	<li>Systems software, including operating systems, network stacks, and programming</li>
	<li>System services such as time and location estimation</li>
	<li>Low-power operation, energy harvesting, and energy management</li>
	<li>Resource-efficient machine learning for embedded and mobile platforms</li>
	<li>Mobile and pervasive systems with elements of networked sensing</li>
	<li>Data management and intelligence, including quality, integrity, and trustworthiness</li>
	<li>Learning algorithms and models for perception, understanding, and adaptation</li>
	<li>Heterogeneous collaborative sensing, including human-robot sensor systems</li>
	<li>Security and privacy in networked sensor applications and systems</li>
	<li>Fault-tolerance, dependability, and verification</li>
	<li>Applications and deployment experiences</li>
</ul>

<p>We invite technical papers describing original ideas, groundbreaking results, and real-world experiences involving innovative networked embedded sensor systems. Successful submissions will explain why the topic is relevant to a vision of the future of sensing systems. Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, clarity, relevance, and correctness.</p>

<h3 id="submission-guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h3>

<p align="justify">Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be full papers, at most <strong>12 single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages</strong> with <strong>10-pt font size in two-column format, including figures and tables</strong>. As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">here</a>. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.</p>

<p align="justify">Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects.</p>

<p>Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference.</p>

<h2>Call for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals</h2>
</header>

<article class="post-content">
The ideal workshop proposal should focus on an innovative and emerging topic that is of strategic and long-term interest to the SenSys community. The ideal tutorial proposal will be for technologies or systems aligned with the interests of the SenSys community and will describe a clear plan of activities and learning objectives for participants. The proposed workshop or tutorial should be able to attract significant interest and valuable contributions that spark active discussions in an informal setting and inspire new research ideas. Also, as highlighted in the call for the SenSys main program, we will encourage workshops or tutorials that focus on novel applications and diversity of ideas, as opposed to more incremental contributions to mature systems.<p></p>

<h3>Submission format</h3>


<p align="justify">The workshop or tutorial proposal should be no longer than three pages. Please note that the submitted proposals are not contracts, nonetheless please try to give thought to everything asked for, as it will help make sure your event is a success. Please ensure your proposal provides the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Title of the workshop or tutorial.</li>
	<li>Names, affiliations, and short bio of the main organizers/program chairs.</li>
	<li>Logistical needs (demos/audio/video projection, etc.)</li>
	<li>Specification whether this is a full-day or a half-day event.</li>
	<li>Brief description of the publicity plan for your event.</li>
	<li>If the workshop or tutorial has been held before, also include its recent history such as prior sponsoring venue(s), the number of submissions/applicants, the number of accepted papers/tutorial participants, and the number of attendees.</li>
</ul>

<h4>For Workshops</h4>
If you plan to submit a proposal for a workshop, you must provide the following information:<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>A brief description of the workshop, including the theme of the workshop, technical issues that the workshop will address, and the reasons why the workshop is of interest at this time.</li>
	<li>Names of potential program committee members (for the first-time workshops, we recommend at least ten candidate program committee members).</li>
	<li>Anticipated number of submissions and participants.</li>
	<li>Tentative call for papers with workshop deadlines (aligned with the relevant important dates below).</li>
</ul>

<h4>For Tutorials</h4>
If you plan to submit a proposal for a tutorial, you must provide the following information:<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>A brief description of the tutorial, which includes a rough outline of the agenda for the tutorial, any additional resources attendees must have (i.e. hardware they must purchase or bring to participate; larger software they must download in advance), and a discussion of why the tutorial will be of interest to members of the SenSys community.</li>
	<li>Anticipated number of attendees. Can this grow, or should attendance be capped?</li>
	<li>Tentative call for attendees with desired registration deadlines.</li>
</ul>

Please email the proposal in PDF format to <b><a href="mailto:p.pawelczak@tudelft.nl">Przemysław Pawełczak</a></b>, <b><a href="mailto:liuyunxin@air.tsinghua.edu.cn">Yunxin Liu</a></b> and <b><a href="mailto:wangfangxin@cuhk.edu.cn">Fangxin Wang</a></b> with "SenSys 2024 [Workshop /Tutorial] Proposal - xxx" (where xxx is the workshop name) as the subject line. Submissions must be received by Monday, May 15th 2024, 23:59 AoE. Emails of all chairs are given below.<p></p>
