      <p>
        SoCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants. 
        All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the CG Week code of conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        A person found in violation of these standards can be barred from attendance. This includes violations and sanctions that were established 
        by other academic or professional institutions as the outcome of a formal enquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an author has a conflict of such nature with a potential reviewer, and the author has sufficient grounds to believe that the review 
        would be negatively biased, then the author is asked to declare this conflict in HotCRP. You are also welcome to contact a SoCG SafeTOC advocate 
        who will treat any supporting information confidentially. For a list of SoCG advocates with contact information, please refer to <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/codeofconduct.html">

                <h5>Paper types</h5>
                <p>
                When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in 
                mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its 
                own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own 
                merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their 
                submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and 
                external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper 
                types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they 
                evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and 
                submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time 
                of submission.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <b>Mathematical Foundations:</b> 
                    A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete 
                    or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological 
                    combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance 
                    of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied 
                    to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm 
                    development.

                    <li>
                    <b>Algorithmic Complexity:</b> 
                    A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, 
                    proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational 
                    geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or 
                    computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, 
                    the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the 
                    proposed new methods and techniques.

                    <b>Experiments and Implementation:</b> 
                    A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluation of geometric 
                    algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the 
                    experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated 
                    on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, 
                    the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained.

                    <li>
                    <b>Applications:</b> 
                    A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational 
                    geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling 
                    decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application 
                    area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry 
                    tools to the specific area.

            <h5>Double Blind and PC submissions</h5>
            <p>
                This year's SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit 
                to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, 
                and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own 
                related work is in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). Particular care needs 
                to be taken if there is any accompanying software or data, which needs to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox folder or 
                 <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/">GitHub</a>, perhaps with a subset of synthetic data if the real data is not anonymized). Upon registering a submission, 
                 the authors will declare conflicts of interest with PC members, as well as listing email address or domain level conflicts (i.e. “Jeff M. Phillips (University of Utah)”, 
                 “All (Freie Universität Berlin)”) of other professional or personal conflicts. The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external 
                 reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors should feel free to 
                disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, 
                submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs, 
                or to see the more detailed discussion in <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/documents/Double_blind_proposal.pdf">the proposal</a>  that preceded the 
                vote to move to double blind.

        <li class="list-group-item">
            <h5>Format</h5>
            <p>
                Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the 
                <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics">LIPIcs proceedings guidelines</a>. 
                Authors must use the LaTeX class file <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/guidelines/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">socg-lipics-v2021.cls</a> (use the one updated in 2022; version 0.9), 
                which is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class. The LIPIcs style and instructions are available 
                <a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors#lipics"> here</a>; the socg-lipics-v2021.cls class file is available 
                <a href="https://computational-geometry.org/guidelines/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">here</a>, and instructions on how to use it 
                are available <a href="https://www.computational-geometry.org/guidelines/linecount_2022_09_19.pdf">here</a>. 
                Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title, authors, and affiliations), 
                references, and a clearly marked appendix	(further described below), but including all other lines 
                (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.). The class files provide line counting which should be
                accurate in most cases. Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of text in parts in which 
                lines are not counted automatically. If authors need constructs that contain uncounted lines of text, 
                they should compensate for this by reducing the final line count accordingly. It is the sole responsibility 
                of the authors to not exceed 500 lines even if some lines are not counted automatically. 
            </p> 
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
        <h5>Contents of the submission</h5>
            <p>
                Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which
                begins with the title of the paper, each author's name and
                affiliation, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by
                the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the
                problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained
                (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the
                research), and a clear comparison with related work. The remainder of
                the extended abstract should provide sufficient details to allow the
                program committee to evaluate the validity, quality, and relevance of
                the contribution. Clarity of presentation is very important; the
                entire extended abstract should be written carefully, taking into
                consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts and
                non-experts, often under tight time constraints.

        <h5>Appendix and additional data</h5>
		    <p>
                All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting
                materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental
                details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an
                appendix. If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the
                appendix. In both cases, however, the authors should include in the
                main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the
                appendix. The appendix will be read by the program committee members
                and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be published as part
                of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix should be
                able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results
                (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and
                verifiable. Authors of all types of papers are encouraged to put
                accompanying software and relevant data, if there are any, in a
                repository accessible to the reviewers. Authors are asked to indicate
                which of the supporting materials will remain publicly available if
                their papers are accepted.

        <h5>Previous or simultaneous submissions</h5>
		    <p>
                Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another 
                conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference 
                with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are workshops and conferences without formal 
                proceedings, but possibly with handouts containing short abstracts. In particular, submissions of 
                papers that have appeared or will be submitted to EuroCG are allowed, since EuroCG does not publish formal 
                proceedings, while submissions of papers that have appeared in CCCG are not allowed. Results that have already 
                been accepted (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their submission 
                to the symposium are not allowed.

                <p>
                    An author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 
                    20 minutes). The format of both attendance and presentation will be clarified closer to the event. Awards will 
                    be given for the best paper and for the best student presentation. Authors of a selection of papers from the symposium 
                    will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/454"> Discrete &amp; Computational Geometry</a>
                    and <a href="https://jocg.org/">Journal of Computational Geometry</a>. As in the previous years, the authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an 
                    extended version of their paper to the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/jacm">Journal of the ACM</a>.

	        <h5>Format</h5>
                <p>
                    Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must respect the same 
                    formatting constraints as the submissions 
                    (<a href="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author">LIPIcs proceedings format</a> with

                    matter and references), but must not comprise any appendix. If any
                    supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical
                    claims and experimental details) does not fit in the specified
                    limit, then the full version of the paper containing this
                    information must be referenced in the conference version and made
                    available at a public repository, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, 
                    by the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the
                    authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly
                    accessible, with proper references in the paper.
