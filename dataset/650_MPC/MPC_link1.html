*** CALL FOR PAPERS -- MPC 2022 ***

14th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction

26th-28th of September 2022, Tbilisi, Georgia

Co-located with the Computational Logic Autumn Summit (CLAS'22)

======================================================================


TIMELINE:

Abstract submission     10th April 2022

Paper submission          17th April 2022

Author notification        27th May 2022

Camera ready copy        24th June 2022

Conference                      26th-28th September 2022


BACKGROUND:

The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction
(MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and
techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the
process of constructing computer programs.

MPC 2022 will be held in Tbilisi, Georgia, on the 26th-28th September
2022, and is co-located with the Computational Logic Autumn Summit (CLAS'22).

Previous conferences were held in Porto, Portugal (2019);
Königswinter, Germany (2015); Madrid, Spain (2012);
Québec City, Canada (2010); Marseille, France (2008);
Kuressaare, Estonia (2006); Stirling, UK (2004); Dagstuhl, Germany (2002);
Ponte de Lima, Portugal (2000); Marstrand, Sweden (1998); Kloster Irsee,
Germany (1995); Oxford, UK (1992); Twente, The Netherlands (1989).


SCOPE:

MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use
in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to
support for program construction in programming languages and systems.
Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation,
programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion
of a 'program' is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware.

Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance
to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome,
provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage
the submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and
instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.


SUBMISSION:

Submission is in two stages. Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words)
must be submitted by 10th April 2022. Full papers (pdf, formatted using
the llncs.sty style file for LaTex) must be submitted by 17th April 2022.
There is no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.
Both abstracts and papers will be submitted using EasyChair.

Papers must present previously unpublished work, and not be submitted
concurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions will be
evaluated by the program committee according to their relevance,
correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission
should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms,
clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is
significant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers must
be presented in person at the conference by one of the authors.

The proceedings of MPC 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science (LNCS) series, as with all previous instances
of the conference.  Authors of accepted papers will be expected to
transfer copyright to Springer for this purpose.

After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2022
will be invited to submit revised versions to a special
issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

For any queries about submission please contact the program chair,
Ekaterina Komendantskaya <ek19@hw.ac.uk> or
publicity chair Matthew Daggitt <m.daggitt@hw.ac.uk>

CONFERENCE VENUE:

The conference will be held at the Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State
University (TSU), which is the oldest and largest educational and
research institution not only in Georgia, but also in the South Caucasus.
The venue is located in the city center, with many hotels, pubs,
restaurants, parks, other attractions (zoo, theaters, cinemas, opera,
etc.) within walking distance.

Tbilisi International Airport is 15 km away from the city and offers
direct connections to more than 30 destinations in Europe, Asia, and the
Middle East. From the airport, the city can be reached by bus or taxi.
Another option is to  fly to Kutaisi in the west of Georgia, where low
budget air companies  (such as WizzAir) are operating. A shuttle bus from
the Kutaisi airport to Tbilisi takes about 3 hours.

Georgia allows visa-free entry for nearly 100 countries around the world.
