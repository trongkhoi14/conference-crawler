<p>The <strong><a href="https://sigspatial.org/">ACM SIGSPATIAL</a> International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems 2024 (ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024)</strong>, the thirty-second edition, will be held in <strong>Atlanta, Georgia, in October 2024</strong>. The conference began as a series of symposia and workshops starting in 1993 with the aim of bringing together researchers, developers, users, and practitioners in relation to novel systems based on geospatial data and knowledge, and fostering interdisciplinary discussions and research in all aspects of geographic information systems. The conference provides a forum for original research contributions covering all conceptual, design, and implementation aspects of geospatial data ranging from applications, user interfaces, and visualization to data storage and query processing and indexing. The conference is the premier annual event of the ACM Special Interest Group on Spatial Information (ACM SIGSPATIAL). Researchers, students, and practitioners are invited to submit their contributions to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2024.</p>

<h4>Paper Format</h4>
<p>Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>. Alterations to the template, especially to gain more space, will be grounds for administrative rejection without further technical review. Submissions to ACM SIGSPATIAL are single-blind -- i.e., the names and affiliations of the authors should be listed in the submitted version. <strong>The author list is considered to be final after the submission deadline and no changes to the author list are allowed for accepted papers.</strong></p>
<p>All papers should be submitted through EasyChair using the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigspatial2024">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigspatial2024</a></p>
<h4>Research, Systems and Industrial Experience Papers</h4>
<p>Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. In addition to regular research papers, authors are invited to submit systems papers, which focus on novel system architectures and software applications, and industrial experience papers, which describe original industrial experiences, challenges, and practical applications. For these papers, authors should append “(Systems Paper) ” or “(Industrial Paper)” to the title, respectively. Submissions are limited to 10 pages (excluding references), with up to 2 additional pages after the references to be used for appendices. References do not count towards the page limit. Submissions that do not follow the page limit requirements will be administratively rejected without any technical reviews. Based on the evaluations from the reviewers, the Program Committee may recommend that certain papers are accepted as 4-page (including references) poster papers for poster presentation. Both full and poster papers will appear in the conference proceedings.</p>
<h4>Vision Papers</h4>
<p>Authors are invited to submit papers describing a visionary proposition foreseeing future directions and compelling research opportunities for the SIGSPATIAL community. Vision papers will be evaluated and selected on their potential of expanding current SIGSPATIAL research agenda by defining new research topics and problems with transformative-impact potential. Authors should not be bound by existing technologies or datasets, but rather look further ahead exploring out-of-box (blue sky) thinking, paradigm change, and quantum leap in knowledge. For instance, papers from 10-20 years ago foreseeing and proposing eco-routing and ride-sharing (and all the technical challenges they would bring) would have been “visionary”, as would papers today presenting opportunities for possibly transdisciplinary work expanding SIGSPATIAL’s research horizon on impactful issues such as quantum computing, climate change, spatial aspects of responsible computing research, and spatial data science for societal good. Papers proposing slightly better solutions to well-studied problems (or variations thereof) with known solutions are not relevant and should not be submitted to this track. Submissions to the Vision Paper track should follow the same formatting as regular papers but are limited to 4 pages (including references) and “(Vision Paper)” should be appended to its title. Accepted vision papers will appear in the conference proceedings, and pending confirmation, the best submission(s), will be eligible for partial travel grants.</p>
<h4>Demonstration Papers</h4>
<p>Authors are invited to submit demo papers describing original systems for demonstration presentation at the conference. Submissions are limited to 4 pages (including references) and “(Demo Paper)” should be appended to the title. Accepted demo papers will appear in the conference proceedings.</p>
<h4>Data and Resources Track</h4>
<p>The vast majority of research work done by SIGSPATIAL's community requires experimentation using suitable datasets. Even though some data portals have been created, most datasets are often found after ad-hoc searches, and may not be well documented. Researchers often also resort to creating and using their own synthetic datasets which are often not published, neither the datasets themselves nor how they were and/or could be (re)generated. This year, we are having the "Dataset and Resources” track at SIGSPATIAL aiming at mitigating those issues by soliciting papers which make spatial data and related resources available and explorable. Papers submitted to this track should describe the datasets in detail, and/or the process to (re)generate them. Submissions are even more valuable if they show how their data can be combined with other open data (e.g. weather, pollution, etc) for potentially solving richer and/or new problems. Thus we also encourage submissions from communities outside ACM SIGSPATIAL that can impact core SIGSPATIAL problems in a new way. Papers submitted to this track should not only describe in detail the datasets, and/or the processes to (re)generate them, but also what are their context and possibly related problems. In order for this initiative to be effective it is necessary that the described datasets and/or generators are (and remain) openly available in a publicly accessible repository, e.g., GitHub. Submitted papers should have “(Data and Resources Paper)” added to their titles, must be no longer than 4 pages (including references) and, if accepted, they will be presented as posters at SIGSPATIAL 2024. </p>
<h4>ACM Policy on Authorship</h4>
<p>Authors should review and follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">ACM Policy on Authorship</a> which includes guidelines on the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions">use of generative AI software tools</a> for manuscript writing. In particular, the authors are responsible for all the submitted manuscripts and they should disclose the use of AI software tools in the paper.</p>
<h4>Registration and Presentation</h4>
<p>Each accepted research, systems, industrial experience, demonstration, data &amp; resources, or vision paper must have a paid author registration (i.e., an author cannot pay a single registration for more than one paper) and one author must attend the conference in person to present the accepted submission. Otherwise, the accepted submission will not appear in the conference proceedings or in the ACM Digital Library version of the conference proceedings.</p>
<h4>Workshop Proposals</h4>
<p>One-day and half-day workshops will be held on the first day of the conference. Workshop proposals are to be submitted in PDF format to the Workshops Chairs (call for proposals to be posted). The proceedings of the workshops will appear in the ACM Digital Library. All proposers and organizers of accepted workshops must register for the workshop or the workshop will be canceled.        </p>
<h4>ACM SIGSPATIAL Student Research Competition</h4>
<p>The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC) offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research before a panel of judges and attendees.</p>
<h4>Programming Contest</h4>
<p>The ACM SIGSPATIAL CUP 2024, with prizes, is a geospatial-focused algorithm competition in which submissions are to address a specific task proposed by the organizers.</p>
