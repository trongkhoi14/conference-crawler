<!-- **Extended abstract option.** 
<p style="text-align:justify;">For some researchers and fields (e.g., social scientists or economists), it is beneficial to retain the option to publish the final paper outside of a conference venue. For other researchers, there is benefit from sharing work that was published in other venues with HCOMP-CI’s interdisciplinary audience. To support these researchers, there is an extended abstract option: publish only an extended abstract in the proceedings, should the paper be accepted. Extended abstracts still must submit a full paper for review. Electing for this extended abstraction option is a commitment to replacing the submitted full paper with a two page extended abstract at publication time. Submissions using this extended abstract option may be previously published elsewhere, or may be submitted for publication elsewhere later. Authors opting for the extended abstract option will have their papers juried rather than peer-reviewed; in other words, these articles will still be considered fully by the program committee, but authors will not receive reviews back—only a decision. Extended abstract papers will be treated like full papers in the conference schedule: they will receive a presentation slot. If the work is previously published, authors must clearly and visibly indicate the original paper and citation in their manuscript. </p>

**Forward-to-journal option.**  
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Typically, accepted conference papers will be published only in the proceedings, and if authors later want to extend or publish the work in another venue, they need to start a new review process. This year, however, we are excited to share that authors will have the opportunity to forward their papers, alongside their existing reviews and reviewers, for consideration to the ACM + SAGE Collective Intelligence journal. The journal will, at its discretion, keep or expand the existing set of reviewers for the article and consider the work for publication in the Collective Intelligence journal, accelerating the journal publication process. This option must be selected at submission time. Papers submitting under the extended abstract option will have reviewers forwarded, but since extended abstract option submissions do not receive written reviews, reviews will not be forwarded. Authors should bear in mind that, if the paper is also published archivally at the conference, the journal may ask for expanded content. </p> -->

<h2 id="relevance-and-topics">Relevance and Topics</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to, including human-centered qualitative studies, HCI design, social computing, machine learning, natural language processing, the broader realms of artificial intelligence (including LLMs and generative AI), economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners, to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> With the unprecedented proliferation of AI systems across all domains and the adoption of machine learning across disciplines, there is a renewed focus on how complex AI systems are built, machine learning models are trained, and relevant data pipelines are set up to ensure responsible practices throughout these lifecycles. The role of human input and intelligence is being widely discussed in the age of LLMs, and generative AI. Human input serves a multitude of important purposes in these contexts, ranging from generation of training data to validation, evaluation, and facilitating oversight. Ensuring that data work is carried out in a fair, ethical, unbiased, and responsible manner every step of the way can help create better AI systems. It is in this spirit that the AAAI HCOMP 2024 theme focuses on "Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI." </p>

<p>Topics of interest include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Methods to efficiently and effectively collect and use human feedback to build Generative AI models (e.g., pairwise judgments for RLHF, PPO, DPO, or statements for Constitutional AI). </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Humans versus LLMs for data annotation (assessment of quality, trade-offs, biases, evaluation, etc.); the use of LLMs for crowd work (hybrid workflows, productivity and work efficiency, quality, biases, oversight, etc.) </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Trust and reliance of crowd workers, data annotators, and other data work experts on LLM-based or generative AI tools. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Approaches to make crowd science FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) and studies assessing and commenting on the FAIRness of human computation and crowdsourcing practice, replicability of crowdsourcing, and human computation experiments. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Techniques that enable and enhance human-in-the-loop systems, making them more efficient, accurate, and human-friendly, including task design, quality assurance, answer inference, biases and subjectivity, incentives, gamification, task allocation, complex workflows, real-time crowdsourcing, etc. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Methods, frameworks, techniques, and tools to help build appropriate reliance of humans on AI systems. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Studies about how people perform tasks individually, in groups, or as a crowd, including those drawing on techniques from human-computer interaction, social computing, computer-supported cooperative work, design, cognitive sciences, behavioral sciences, economics, etc. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Data quality aspects of human-annotated and -curated datasets. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Human computation and crowdsourcing to build people-centric AI systems and applications, including topics such as explainability and interpretability. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Fairness, accountability, transparency, ethics, and policy implications for crowdsourcing and human computation. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Studies about how people and intelligent systems interact and collaborate, coordinate, or compete, and studies exploring the influences and impact of intelligent systems on society.
</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Crowdsourcing applications and techniques, including but not limited to citizen science, collective action, collective intelligence, the wisdom of crowds, crowdsourcing contests, crowd creativity, crowdfunding, paid microtasks, crowd ideation, crowd sensing, and prediction markets. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Studies that inform our understanding of the future of work, distributed work, the freelancer economy, open innovation, and citizen-led innovation. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Submissions may, therefore, cover theory, user studies, tools, and applications that present novel, interesting, impactful interactions between people and computational systems. These cover a broad range of scenarios, from classical human computation, the wisdom of crowds, and all forms of crowdsourcing to people-centric AI methods, systems, and applications. </p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Authors are invited to submit anonymized full papers of variable length up to a maximum of 8 pages (including all content, figures, and tables). Additional pages may contain references only (<i>i.e., max. 8 pages + references</i>). Shorter and focussed submissions are welcome and reviewers will assess the contributions of the work accordingly. Papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style; please refer to the AAAI 2023 Author Kit for details (available templates: <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/aaai-2023-author-kit/wxnmhzcrjbpc">AAAI 2023 Author Kit on Overleaf</a> or <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit24-2/">AAAI 2024 Author Kit.zip [Word | LaTeX]</a>). The AAAI copyright block is not required on submissions but must be included in the final accepted versions. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as executables and data files so that reviewers can reproduce results in the paper, images, additional videos, related papers, more detailed explanations, derivations, or results. These materials will be viewed only at the reviewers’ discretion, who are only obligated to read the submitted papers. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> If your paper is accepted, you will be required to present it in person at the AAAI HCOMP 2024 conference in Pittsburgh. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the main conference to present the work or acceptance will be withdrawn. </p>

<h2 id="submission-requirements-and-processes">SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND PROCESSES</h2>

<p><strong>Anonymity.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> HCOMP 2024 will adopt a double-blind review process. Submissions should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. Submissions not complying with this guidance will be desk-rejected. </p>

<p><strong>Preprint servers.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> We do not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until that process is complete. Please do not share confidential info specific to a current review process on social media or in similarly public forums. </p>

<p><strong>Conflicts of interest.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> To ensure fairness, authors should declare any conflicts of interest with PC members by selecting the “Declare Conflicts” link on the upper-right of your EasyChair submission page. </p>

<p><strong>Double Submission Policy</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Papers submitted to the HCOMP conference must represent original work that has not been previously published or that is not under simultaneous peer-review for any other peer-reviewed archival conference or journal. Note that: </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Papers that have appeared at a conference with published proceedings constitute previously published work. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Papers that overlap with other papers that have appeared at a conference with published proceedings must contain significant new results. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> Papers that have appeared at a workshop do not constitute previously published work, as long as the paper submitted to HCOMP is an extension of the workshop paper. Extensions might include new results, more in-depth analysis, an evaluation that was not part of the workshop paper, or further experiments. </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Review Criteria.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Reviewers will be instructed to evaluate paper submissions according to specific <a href="/review-criteria.html">review criteria</a>, some of which is unique to HCOMP. Our intent in posting these review criteria online is to further improve transparency of the conference's peer-review process and to provide additional guidance to authors in preparing their submissions (especially for young researchers, as well as researchers from diverse disciplines). <br>
We encourage authors to review these criteria and contact us with any questions or feedback. Tweet us <a class="theme-link" href="https://twitter.com/hcomp_conf">@hcomp_conf</a> or email us at <a class="theme-link" href="mailto:hcomp24@easychair.org">hcomp24@easychair.org</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Reviews.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Each paper will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee and one SPC member. Reviewers will be instructed to evaluate submissions according to specific review criteria. We encourage authors to review them before submission. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> To ensure relevance, authors should consider including research questions and contributions of broad interest to crowdsourcing and human computation, as well as discuss relevant open problems and prior work in the field. When the evaluation is conducted within a specific domain, authors are encouraged to discuss how findings might generalize to other communities and application areas using crowdsourcing and human computation. </p>

<p><strong>Attendance.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> To present a talk at HCOMP 2024, authors must submit a full paper for review by the program committee. Accepted papers will be granted a presentation at the conference. Therefore, submitting a full paper is a mandatory requirement for authors who wish to present their work at the conference. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> To be included in the proceedings and the conference program, at least one author must register in person for the main conference. The registration needs to occur by the camera-ready deadline.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> If your paper is accepted, we are delighted to invite you to present your work at the conference. Please note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register for the main conference to present their work in person. Failure to do so will result in the withdrawal of acceptance. Remote presentation of accepted papers is not permitted except in the case of unforeseen circumstances. The deadline for registering to present your paper is the same as the camera-ready deadline. </p>

<h2 id="paper-awards">PAPER AWARDS</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> HCOMP 2024 will recognize one best paper, one best student paper, and up to two runner-ups. Reviewers will be asked to flag papers they deem worthy of a prize. The general chairs will set up a small committee that will read the nominated papers, consider the comments of the reviewers, and assess the presentation to determine the winners. </p>

<h1 class="sub-page-header" id="wip">HCOMP CALL FOR WORKS-IN-PROGRESS (WiP) AND DEMONSTRATION PAPERS</h1>
<p class="sub-page-border">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">To be announced. Stay tuned!</p>

<!-- 
## Important Dates
- August 21: Works-in-Progress Papers and Demonstration papers due (23:59 AoE)
- September 4: WiP and Demo notifications sent
- September 14: Accepted WIP and Demos on conference website


## Overview

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The Works-in-Progress and Demonstration track focuses on recent findings or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work, hands-on demonstration, novel methods, technologies and experiences relevant to the HCOMP and CI communities. We also welcome work published in other venues to encourage sharing work with HCOMP-CI’s interdisciplinary audience. We encourage practitioners and researchers to submit to the Works-in-Progress & Demo Track as it provides a unique opportunity for sharing valuable insights and ideas, eliciting useful feedback on early-stage work, and fostering discussions and collaborations among colleagues. Submissions are welcome from multiple fields, ranging from computer science, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction, to economics, business, and the social sciences, all the way to digital humanities, policy, and ethics. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Accepted papers in this track will be non-archival and they will not be included in the official proceedings of the HCOMP/CI conference. They will be made available online on the conference website. Authors of accepted papers can thus benefit from exchanging insights on their work, while maintaining the option to further develop their idea and submit the outcome to other venues.  </p>


### Works-in-Progress

<p style="text-align:justify;"> A Work-in-Progress is a concise report of recent findings or other types of innovative or thought-provoking work relevant to the HCOMP and/or CI community. The difference between Works-in-Progress and other types of contribution is that Work-in-Progress submissions represent work that has not yet reached a level of completion that would warrant the full Refereed selection process. That said, appropriate submissions should make some contribution to the body of HCOMP/CI knowledge, whether realized or promised. A significant benefit of a Work-in-Progress derives from the discussion between the author and the conference attendees. Work-in-Progress submissions are in the form of a 2-3 page paper; see Submission section. Authors of accepted Works-In-Progress will present their paper in-person at the conference in the form of a poster. </p>


### Demonstrations

<p style="text-align:justify;"> A demonstration is a high-visibility, high-impact forum of the HCOMP/CI program that allows you to present your hands-on demonstration, share novel technologies and tools, and stage interactive experiences. Demonstrations will showcase this year’s most exciting human computation, collaborative human-AI, and collective intelligence prototypes and systems. If you have an interesting prototype, system, exhibit or installation, we want to know about it. Sharing hands-on experiences of your work is often the best way to communicate what you have created. The demonstration submission should describe the nature of the system as well as the expected form of interaction with the user and the audience. Demonstrations submissions are in the form of a 2-3 page paper; see Submission section. </p>


## Submission

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Submissions for both HCOMP and CI Works-In-Progress and Demo papers must be done via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hcomp23">HCOMP/CI 2023 EasyChair Website </a> under the Works-in-Progress and Demonstration track. Submissions to Easychair are required on or before the deadline listed above. We cannot accept submissions by e-mail. Authors will receive confirmation of receipt of their submissions, including an ID number, shortly after submission. HCOMP/CI will contact authors again only if problems are encountered with their papers. </p>


### Length

Works-in-Progress and Demonstration papers must be between 2 and 3 pages of content. References can extend beyond the page limit. 


### Formatting

HCOMP papers must be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style; please refer to the <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Publications/Templates/AuthorKit23.zip">AAAI 2023 Author Kit</a> for details. Papers must be in trouble-free, high-resolution PDF format, formatted for US Letter (8.5″ x 11″) paper, using Type 1 or TrueType fonts. The AAAI copyright block is not required for works-in-progress or demo submissions, as they are not included in the formal proceedings. Please see below for information about publication.


### Supplemental Materials

Authors are invited, but not required, to include supplemental materials such as executables and data files so that the results of the work can be reproduced. 


### NOT Anonymized

Authors should include information identifying themselves and their institutions for single-blind review.


### NOT Archival


<p style="text-align:justify;"> Accepted papers will NOT be included in official conference proceedings, and therefore they could be submitted later to other conferences or journals for official publication. Accepted papers will be made available online on the conference website.  </p>


## Contacts

Please contact the Works-in-Progress and Demonstration Co-Chairs if you have any questions.

<h1 class="sub-page-header" id="workshops">Call for Workshops</h1>
<p class="sub-page-border">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
We invite proposals for workshops at HCOMP 2024. Workshops bring together communities with common research interests and agendas to discuss ongoing work and initiate new collaborations. Workshops may address research, best practices, tools, education, emerging themes and applications, and critical thinking about existing methodologies and frameworks. Topics should be within the general scope of HCOMP but may include emerging research directions that have not yet been fully explored and may even be seen as controversial. We welcome submissions from both academia and industry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Note that <b>workshops this year will be entirely in-person.</b>

## WHAT IS CROWDCAMP?


<p style="text-align:justify;"> CrowdCamp is a hybrid hack-a-thon for researchers and practitioners with interests in crowdsourcing, human computation, collective intelligence, and AI. The focus is on creating a first prototype, study design, an idea for a new algorithm, a pilot study, or something else entirely within the workshop itself. Prior CrowdCamp projects have resulted in top-tier conference publications, blog posts, and on-going research.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> As the theme for this year’s CrowdCamp, we propose generative AI which is revolutionizing various fields, including art, entertainment, and education. However, the full potential of generative AI is yet to be realized, and the role of human intelligence and crowd computing in shaping generative AI is critical for AI alignment. Similarly, there is a need for a timely response to systematically identify and mitigate safety concerns in all generative models that are currently available (see, for instance, <a href="https://www.dataperf.org/adversarial-nibbler">the Adversarial Nibbler data challenge</a>). </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from both the crowdsourcing and collective intelligence disciplines to explore innovative ideas as well as the challenges associated with generative AI models. We also welcome any other ideas that participants want to work on. </p>

## CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

<p style="text-align:justify;">  We invite students, faculty, and industry researchers to participate, from social scientists to programmers, ethnographers to designers, and anyone else interested. Everyone is welcome! </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">  To apply to participate, we ask that you complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfc3m-3POFNsWal2yuIxwD2SqIinu3j0ILOFG8EEUjdJ7tHPg/viewform?usp=sf_link">the CrowdCamp 2023 application form</a>. The application takes about 10 minutes to complete, and asks for: </p>

- **One Hack-a-Thon Idea**: A project idea or application domain that you care about. This may be viewed by other participants, but if you are accepted to CrowdCamp, you will still be free to change your idea. We are looking for ideas that are specific rather than vague. The goal is to generate ideas that a group of 3-5 people can finish during the workshop. 
- **Your Research Interests and Experience**: We are looking for a diverse group of people that will develop amazing projects during CrowdCamp. We therefore ask you to indicate your research interests and expertise in crowdsourcing – whether they be in HCI, AI, or in another field. 
- **Your Ideal CrowdCamp Partner or Research Team**: We want to make sure you get an awesome partner / team for your CrowdCamp hack-a-thon. Depending on your project and research interests, we’d love to know if you’re looking for partner(s) with a particular type of expertise or whether you are joining with an existing team. Ideally, we would like to have people with different types of expertise (e.g., HCI and AI people) working together as a team! 
- **Your Contact Information**: Name and email.

## CROWDCAMP FORMAT

<p style="text-align:justify;"> This year, CrowdCamp will be a hybrid experience. Accepted participants may choose to attend on-site or remotely. Throughout the day, there will be touchpoints where virtual and on-site groups can connect and showcase their work. We'll try to integrate the virtual teams via live streaming and shared sessions to create an inclusive environment for all attendees. More details to be shared shortly. </p>

### Key Dates (all times are midnight AoE)

- **Deadline for sign-up**:	October 6, 2023 (You need to register to the conference or the workshop day to participate in CrowdCamp. Note that the early conference registration deadline is much earlier!)
- **Notification**:	October 13, 2023

# FAQs
{:.sub-page-header}
{:#faq}
&nbsp;
{:.sub-page-border}


<b> 1. What does the co-location mean to authors? </b>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The co-location means that you'll have the unique opportunity to reach a much broader audience. In addition to the typical HCOMP community, your work will also be accessible to the CI community, which includes researchers from diverse fields such as citizen science, complex networks, and political science. Your paper presentation will have the potential to make an impact across multiple fields simultaneously. Furthermore, the co-location  presents an excellent opportunity to connect with new researchers and explore new fields that could influence your work. It could even inspire your research to take new and exciting directions that you may not have previously considered. </p>


<b> 2. How can they decide which conference they need to submit? </b>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Please submit your paper to the conference that you would typically choose. In the event that we determine your paper may be a better fit for another conference, we will provide guidance to help you make the best decision for your research. </p>


<b> 3. Can they submit to CI and present at the HCOMP? </b>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Absolutely! Both conferences will feature the papers presented at each other, creating a unique opportunity for cross-pollination and collaboration between the two communities. All papers will be presented and exposed to both HCOMP and CI audiences, facilitating the exchange of ideas and the development of new insights. </p>


<b> 4. Will the review process be different in both conferences or do they share the same. </b>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> The review process for each conference will follow its typical procedure. This ensures that all papers are evaluated according to the same rigorous standards and criteria that are standard for each conference. </p>

<b> 5. Can attendees see all the CI and HCOMP content if they register only for one conference? </b>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> Yes. Attendees just have to register for ONE conference, either HCOMP or CI. </p>

<b> 6. And for authors, Do we both have to register for both conferences? </b>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> -No. You again only need to register for one conference. Make sure at least one author registers for the conference in which you have a paper.   Per ACM and AAAI requirements we need one author registered for the conference in which they are publishing the paper. </p>
