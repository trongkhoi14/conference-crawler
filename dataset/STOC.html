      <b>The 55th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2023)</b>,
      sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and
      Computation Theory (<a href="http://www.sigact.org/">SIGACT</a>),
      will be held in Orlando, Florida from <b>Tuesday, June 20 </b>to <b>Friday, June 23.</b>
      STOC will be part
      of<!--<a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2023/">Theory Fest</a>
and--> <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">FCRC</a>.


</p><p>
Papers presenting new and original research on the
      theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete
      optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed
      algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory,
      computational geometry, computational applications of logic,
      algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects
      of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks,
      data management, databases and computational biology.  Papers that
      extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important
      problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and
      analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every
      effort to consider a broad range of areas.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Submission format:</b> Submissions should start with a title
      page consisting of the title of the paper<!--; each author's name,
      affiliation, and email address;--> and an abstract of a few paragraphs
      summarizing the paper's contributions.  <b>Submissions should not contain the authors' names</b> (more on this below).
      There is no page limit and
      authors are encouraged to use the "full version" of their paper as
      the submission.  Each submission should contain within the initial
      ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the
      merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's
      importance within the context of prior work and a description of
      the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main
      claims.
      This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of
      theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea.  Proofs must be
      provided which can enable the main mathematical claims of the
      paper to be fully verified.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although there is no bound on the length of a submission,
      material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten
      pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are
      encouraged to put the references at the very end of the
      submission. 
      The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts,
      in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with
      ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on
      letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper.  Submissions deviating
      significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without
      consideration of their merits.
      <br>
<br>
All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.
<br>
      <br>
      Authors are encouraged to
      include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries,
      theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page
      immediately following the title page; this will not count
      towards the first ten pages. 
      <br>
      <br>
<b>Submission pdf files should not have author names on them;</b> author names and institution information will be uploaded separately. PC members will have access to author names if they want this information, but names should not appear on the actual submitted papers themselves. This will make it easier for PC members to remove possible unconscious biases if they want to be unaware of the identity of authors.
<!--disregard the identiiesinformation if they want, but will not Alphabetical
      orderings of author names can lead to
      <a href="https://researchonresearch.blog/2018/11/28/theres-lots-in-a-name/">biases</a>,
      so authors may consider randomizing author orderings for your
      papers.
      <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/random-author-order/generator">Here </a>
      and <a href="https://www.pbegames.com/rlist/">here</a> are links to
some randomization tools.
      Randomization of the author order can be indicated using
      \textcircled{r} instead of a comma as a name delimiter, or 
      using a footnote on the title page using \thanks{}.
-->
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Recommended best practices for citations:</b> 
	Authors are asked to avoid "et al." in citations in
      favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the
      number of authors is large, consider writing "\cite{XYZ}
      show..." instead of "X et al. show". Bibliographic references
      should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of
      the authors' surnames (or at least the first three followed by a
      +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical
      reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using
      \bibliographystyle{alpha}.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>PC Member Submissions:</b> Submissions by PC members are allowed. If any of the authors of
      a submission is a PC member, this should be indicated in the
      submission form by clicking the corresponding bullet. 
    </p>

    <p><b>Conflict of Interest Policy:</b> STOC 2023 will use the
      following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC
      (see <a href="http://safetoc.org/index.php/conflict-of-interest-sample-wording/">here</a>)
      and the ACM Conflict of
      Interest <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest">policy</a>.
      Upon submission, authors are given the opportunity to declare
      conflicts of interest. They should limit this declaration to the
      following categories:
      </p><ol>
	<li>Family member or close friend.</li>
	<li>Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.</li>
	<li>Person with the same affiliation.</li>
	<li>Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)</li>
	<li>Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).</li>
	<li>Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint
	funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected
	within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work.</li>
      </ol>
      If you are unsure about a conflict in which a reviewer may have
      positive bias towards your paper, we recommend erring on the
      side of not declaring it since PC members and sub-reviewers will
      be also asked if they feel that they can fairly evaluate your
      paper.  If an author believes that they have a valid reason for
      a conflict of interest not listed above, then he or she can
      contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this
      conference directly.  Note that if the program chair has reason
      to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then
      he/she may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the
      reason for the conflict.  Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do
      not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without
      consideration of merit.  If authors are uncertain, they are
      encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.  The
      submission software asks for conflicts with PC members, and in
      addition contains a text form in which one can declare
      additional conflicts.
    <p></p>

    <p><b>Submission Instructions:</b> Authors are required to submit
      their papers electronically, in PDF (without security
      restrictions on copying or printing).
</p><p>
<b>The <a href="http://stoc23.hotcrp.com">submission server</a> is now open.</b>
    </p>

    <p>Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their
      submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as
      the <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>,
      <a href="http://www.eccc.uni-trier.de/">ECCC</a>, or
      the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/">Cryptology ePrint
	archive</a>.  (Papers that are not written well enough for
      public dissemination are probably also not ready for submission
      to STOC.) It is expected that authors of accepted papers will
      make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the
      camera-ready deadline.
    </p>
ACM is moving to require ORCIDs for all authors, in particular for authors of conference papers starting on October 1, 2022.  An ORCID is an identifier that uniquely identifies an author.  It connects an author's work even if there are variations in the names used on different papers, ensuring that the author gets credit for all of their contributions.  Using ORCIDs will help ACM administer the ACM OPEN program where universities get open-access publishing via a subscription, aid in identifying conflicts of interests, and support other publications processes.  ORCIDs are easy to obtain; it takes less than a minute. 

    <p>
      <b>Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:</b> The conference will
      follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous
      submissions. Work that has been previously published in another
      conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for
      publication prior to July 2023, will not be considered for
      acceptance at STOC 2023.  The only exception to this policy are
      prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and
      Nature journals.  SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous
      submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to
      another conference with published proceedings. <!-- The only exception -->
      <!-- are papers submitted to COLT 2021 that will be withdrawn from COLT -->
      <!-- if accepted to STOC (see the COLT 2021 call for papers as -->
      <!-- well). --> The program committee may consult with program chairs of
      other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely
      related submissions.
    </p>

    
<p>
<!--
<b> Presentation of papers at STOC 2023:</b>  One author per paper is expected to attend the conference in person to present it unless there are strong reasons not to, including international travel restrictions due to COVID-19 or impossibility to travel for all the authors of the paper.

    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Publication date:</b> AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official
      publication date is the date the proceedings are made available
      in the ACM Digital Library.  This date may be up to two weeks
      prior to the first day of your conference.  The official
      publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
      related to published work.  (For those rare conferences whose
      proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the
      conference is over, the official publication date remains the
      first day of the conference.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Presentation of Accepted Papers:</b> One author of each
      accepted paper will be expected to register
      and present the work in the form of a talk at the
      conference unless there are strong reasons not to, including international travel restrictions due to COVID-19 or impossibility to travel for all the authors of the paper.
 In addition, one or more authors may be expected to
      present the work in a <it>poster session</it>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Best Paper Award:</b> The program committee may designate up
      to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best
      Papers. PC member submissions are not eligible for the Best
      Paper award. All other submissions are automatically eligible.

      <b>Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:</b> A prize of $500
      will be given to the author(s) of the best student authored
      paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a
      tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time
      students at the time of submission. To inform the program
      committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box
      in the web form on the submission server.  The list of past
      winners can be found at
