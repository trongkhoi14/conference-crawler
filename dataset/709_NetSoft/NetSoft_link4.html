<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">AIM AND SCOPE</span></h3>

<p>The 6th PVE-SDN workshop aims to explore potential challenges and solutions for the goal of provisioning network performance in next generation virtualized and software-defined network environments. The emergence of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) as two pillars of a new networking paradigm has led to design and deployment of elastic content- and service-delivery virtual networks on cloud-based data centers whose backbones consist of software-defined substrate physical networks. This dynamic, multi-layer architecture for network functions introduces new challenges in maintaining performance and quality of service/quality of experience (QoS/QoE) for service providers and requires new ideas and frameworks in performance measurement and network management. This workshop aims to bring together academic and industry researchers from software-defined ecosystems to identify and discuss technical challenges and state of the art techniques from the perspective of providing and maintaining the expected services, and contemporary results related to performance analysis of SDN and NFV environments.</p>

<h2><span style="color:#0066cc;">SECSOFT 2024: 6<sup>TH</sup>&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CYBER-SECURITY IN SOFTWARE-DEFINED AND VIRTUALIZED INFRASTRUCTURES</span></h2>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">WORKSHOP PAGE</span></h3>

<p><a href="https://www.secsoft-workshop.org/cfp.html">https://www.secsoft-workshop.org/cfp.html</a></p>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">AIM AND SCOPE</span></h3>

<p>Evolving business models are progressively reshaping ICT services and infrastructures, with a growing "softwarization" trend, the massive introduction of virtualization paradigms, and the tight integration with the physical environment. Agile, ubiquitous, pervasive, and programmable networking infrastructures are now leveraging new computation models, where the dynamic and data-driven composition of services disregards the traditional physical and administrative boundaries. Unfortunately, the evolution of cyber-security paradigms has not followed with the same pace, leading to a substantial gap in solutions capable of protecting the new forms of distributed and heterogeneous systems against an evolving landscape of cyber-threats. This is especially worrying considering that part of this overwhelming technological evolution is already encompassing critical infrastructures and industrial systems, such as smart grid components, connected cars and other merging applications within the IoT.</p>

<p>The predominant interspersion of lonely valuable resources with unsafe computing and communication infrastructures makes the application of security perimeter model ineffective. The traditional security tools that organizations have long relied on to protect their networks (i.e., antivirus, intrusion prevention systems, firewalls) are no longer capable of providing sufficient security guarantees against the rapid escalation of advanced persistent threats and multi-vector attacks. The growing complexity of cyber-attacks are urgently demanding more correlation in space and time of (apparently) independent events and logs, and a a higher degree of coordination among different security mechanisms.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">TOPICS OF INTEREST</span></h3>

<p>The SecSoft workshop aims to gather together novel approaches for providing organizations the appropriate situational awareness in relation to cyber security threats allowing them to quickly detect and effectively respond to sophisticated cyber-attacks. The specific target is complementary research works on complementary cyber-security aspects for virtualized and software-defined infrastructures, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cyber-security platforms and architectures for digital services;</li>
	<li>Security, trust and privacy for industrial systems and the IoT (including smart grids);</li>
	<li>Monitoring and advanced data collection and analytics;</li>
	<li>Virtual and software-based cyber-security functions;</li>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">AIM AND SCOPE</span></h3>

<p>The 3rd International Workshop on Edge Network Softwarization (ENS 2024) will be co-hosted at the 10th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft 2024) that will be held from June 24th to June 28th, 2024 in St. Louis, USA.</p>

<p>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) along with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are playing a fundamental role in the softwarization of the network infrastructure. In particular, both technologies have revolutionized the way network functions and services are offered, which are often (partially) pushed towards the edge for enhanced performance, improved privacy, better agility and significant cost reduction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accordingly, this workshop aims at providing an overview of the softwarization process that has started occurring in recent years and is involving the network edge, with focus on future-proof approaches that will be part of the advanced 5G&amp;B and 6G network solutions. Edge network softwarization is a fundamental topic that has to be thoroughly investigated and pushed by the research community.

<h2><span style="color:#0066cc;">WIN 2024: 4<sup>TH</sup>&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON INTENT-BASED NETWORKING</span></h2>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">WORKSHOP PAGE</span></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.adda-association.org/win-2024/">http://www.adda-association.org/win-2024/</a></p>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">AIM AND SCOPE</span></h3>

<p>Intent Based Networking (IBN) focuses on technology-agnostic, flexible and robust interactions between network infrastructure management and operating systems and their users. One of the main goals of IBN is the lifecycle automation and deployment acceleration of communication services and applications. As such, IBN articulates various mechanisms to recognize, understand, augment and refine intents based on service and operational requests. Intent-based systems continuously strive to fulfill and assure service and network operation within the expected qualitative and performance boundaries, thanks to reliable system feedback.</p>

<p>The concept of IBN appeared in the 2010’s with a focus on automated policy configuration. IBN now reaches out to versatile applications and services deployed over heterogeneous digital communication infrastructures. A core challenge of IBN solutions is the stretch between generalization of the application scope (potentially spanning horizontally and vertically end-to-end through networks) and the need of to run in a well-defined network scope and associated knowledge domains, while preserving enough flexibility.</p>

<p>The goal of this workshop is to gather research and experiments from industry, academia, standards and open-source works, to get a sense of IBN technology maturity, areas that require further exploration, development and validation. To this end, the workshop will cover IBN aspects of all domains including applications, concepts, lifecycle, challenges, architectures, modeling, instantiation, robustness, etc.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#0066cc;">TOPICS OF INTEREST</span></h3>

<p>Topics of interest include and are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>IBN concepts, architectures, and frameworks</li>
	<li>IBN enabling techniques: knowledge graphs, natural languages understanding, policy refinement, feedback control loops, smart telemetry, etc.</li>
	<li>IBN support by machine learning and artificial intelligence</li>
	<li>IBN applications and use cases, including scenarios combining digital infrastructures and vertical industries</li>
	<li>IBN proof-of-concepts, experimentations; report on field trials and real-world deployments</li>
	<li>IBN and digital twins</li>
	<li>IBN implementations, tools, and user interface design</li>
	<li>IBN applications for 5G, 5G-Advanced and 6G networks</li>
