								<p class="mb10">The Asia &amp; Pacific Bioinformatics Joint Conference (APBJC) is a collaborative platform aimed at expediting the advancement of bioinformatics in the Asia &amp; Pacific region. This joint initiative is primarily organized by the Japanese Society for Bioinformatics (JSBi), Asia - Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNET), International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB), the International Conference on Genome Informatics (GIW), and the Asia-Pacific Bioinformatics Conference (APBC). APBJC also benefits from the active involvement and support of numerous regional bioinformatics societies, reflecting a collective commitment to fostering progress and innovation in the field.</p>
								<p>APBJC 2024 welcomes abstract submissions featuring research at the forefront of bioinformatics and computational biology. We encourage the submission of original work, whether it is in progress or has been previously published within the last 18 months, for consideration for oral and/or poster presentation.</p>
								<p>All presentations are categorized based on scientific topics, ensuring a cohesive organization of talks and posters. Please ensure that your abstract communicates a scientific result and refrains from serving as an advertisement for any commercial software package or products.</p>

									<h3 class="heading_h3"><span>Guidelines for Multiple talks</span></h3>
									<p>To ensure diverse content and maximize participation, the same oral presentation is not permitted to be delivered more than once at APBJC 2024. However, research may be presented in both oral and poster formats. While having the same individual present two (or more) distinct talks is allowed, it is not encouraged. Furthermore, while a presenting author is welcome to present more than one poster, these should not be posters which are scheduled in the same poster session. We strongly encourage labs to engage multiple lab members to foster a collaborative and comprehensive representation of their research efforts.</p>
