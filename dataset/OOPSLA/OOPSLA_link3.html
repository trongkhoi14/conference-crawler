Papers accepted at either of the rounds will be published in the 2024 
volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to be presented at the SPLASH 
conference in October 2024.

### Scope

The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages 
(PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical 
investigations of programming languages, systems and environments.
Papers may target any stage of software development, including 
requirements, modelling, prototyping, design, implementation, 
generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, 
and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the 
development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.

#### Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing with submission deadlines 
around October and April each year. As you submit your paper you will 
receive around three reviews and an opportunity to provide an author 
response that will be read and addressed by the reviewers in the final 
decision outcome summary. There are 5 possible outcomes at the end of 
the round:

*Accept*: Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL
(OOPSLA).

*Conditional Accept*: You will receive a list of required revisions 
that you will need to address. You must submit a revised paper, a clear 
explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and 
"if possible" a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. Assuming 
you meet the listed requirements, after further review by the same 
reviewers, your paper will very likely  be accepted. This process 
*has to be completed within two months of the initial decision* for the 
paper to be accepted, so we encourage timely turnaround in case 
revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted.

*Minor Revision*: The reviewers have concerns that go beyond what can 
be enumerated in a list. Therefore, while you may receive a list of 
revisions suggested by the reviewers, this will not necessarily be 
comprehensive. You will have the opportunity to resubmit your revised
paper and have it re-reviewed by the same reviewers, which may or may
not result in your paper's acceptance. When you resubmit, you should 
clearly explain how the revisions address the comments of the 
reviewers, by including a document describing the changes and "if 
possible" a diff of the PDF as supplementary material. This process 
*has to be completed within two months of the initial decision* for the 
paper to be accepted in the current round, so we encourage timely 
turnaround in case revisions take more than one cycle to be accepted.

*Major Revision*: You will receive a list of revisions suggested by the 
reviewers. Papers in this category are *invited to submit a revision 
to the next round of submissions* with a specific set of expectations 
to be met. When you resubmit, you should clearly explain how the 
revisions address the comments of the reviewers, by including a 
document describing the changes and "if possible" a diff of the PDF as 
supplementary material. The revised paper will be re-evaluated in the 
next round. Resubmitted papers will retain the same reviewers 
throughout the process to the extent possible.

*Reject*: Rejected papers will not be included in the upcoming volume 
of PACMPL(OOPSLA). Papers in this category are not guaranteed a review 
if resubmitted less than one year from the date of the original 
submission. A paper will be judged to be a resubmission if it is 
substantially similar to the original submission. The Chairs will 
decide whether or not a paper is a resubmission of the same work.

### Submissions

Submitted papers must be at most **23 pages** in 10 point font. There 
is no page limit on references. No appendices are allowed on the main 
paper, instead authors can upload supplementary material with no page 
or content restrictions, but reviewers may choose to ignore it. 
Submissions must adhere to the "ACM Small" template available from 
[the ACM](http://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions). Papers 
are expected to use author-year citations. Author-year citations may be 
used as either a noun phrase, such as "The lambda calculus was 
originally conceived by Church (1932)", or a parenthetic phase, such 
as "The lambda calculus (Church 1932) was intended as a foundation for 
mathematics".

PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors' identities are only 
revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must

1. omit author names and institutions,
2. use the third person when referencing your work,
3. anonymise supplementary material.

Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the 
submission; see the DBR FAQ. When in doubt, contact the Review 
Committee Chairs.

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted 
for publication elsewhere as described by [SIGPLAN's Republication  
Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication). 
Submitters should also be aware of [ACM's Policy and Procedures on 
Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy). 
Submissions are expected to comply with the [ACM Policies for 
Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/information-for-authors).

#### Artifacts

Authors should indicate with their initial submission if an artifact 
exists, describe its nature and limitations, and indicate if it will 
be submitted for evaluation. Accepted papers that fail to provide an 
artifact will be requested to explain the reason they cannot support 
replication. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. 
Please note that the artifact submission deadline will be following 
closely the paper submission deadline so make sure you check the 
Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper to PACMPL(OOPSLA).

##### Data-Availability Statement

To help readers find data and software, OOPSLA recommends adding a 
section just before the references titled Data-Availability Statement. 
If the paper has an artifact, cite it here. If there is no artifact, 
this section can explain how to obtain relevant code. The statement 
does not count toward the OOPSLA 2024 page limit. It may be included 
in the submitted paper; in fact we encourage this, even if the DOI is 
not ready yet.

Example:

\section{Conclusion}
....

\section*{Data-Availability Statement}
The software that supports~\cref{s:design,s:evaluation}
is available on Software Heritage~\cite{artifact-swh}
and Zenodo~\cite{artifact-doi}.

\begin{acks}
....

#### Expert PC Members

During the submission, we will ask you to list up to 3 non-conflicted 
PC members who you think are experts on the topic of this submission, 
starting with the most expert. This list will not be used as an input 
during the paper assignment and it will not be visible to the PC. It 
may be used by the PC Chair and Associate Chairs for advice on 
external experts if the paper lacks expert reviews. 

### Publication

PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal, all papers will be freely 
available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article 
processing charge ($400 USD), but payment is not required. The 
official publication date is the date the journal is made available in 
the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers may 
be published up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. 
The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent 
filings related to published work.

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are 
acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM 
Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), 
including ACM’s [new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human 
Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). 
Alleged violations of this policy or an ACM Publications Policy will 
be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your 
paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM 
Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain [an ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/register), 
so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. 
ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently 
made a [commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published 
authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs). 
We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper 
attribution and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name 
normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship 
Policy in several ways:

- Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications 
process
- Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of 
authors
- Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased 
authorship
- Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and 
providing additional details

You can find the updated policy here:
