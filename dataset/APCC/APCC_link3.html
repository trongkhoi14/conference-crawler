--- SCOPE ---
The Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications 2023 (APCC2023) is an annual
event bringing together exceptional researchers and cutting-edge innovators
from industries and academics around the world.

The 28th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC) will
be held in Sydney, Australia 19-22 November, 2023 and hosted by Western Sydney
University.

The theme of this year’s conference is Sustainable and Resilient Communications
for Innovation. In addition to high-quality technical sessions, the symposium
will feature exciting keynotes, tutorials and workshops.
It will also offer a fantastic social program.

---TECHNICAL PROGRAM---
The conference program will run for three days with the regular tracks, special
sessions, tutorials and workshops. For the tracks and special sessions, we invite
you to contribute your original work on topics in the following, but not limited
to, areas:

・Signal Processing for Communications
  Advanced equalization, channel estimation, signal detection,
  and synchronization techniques
  Novel architectures for signal demodulation and decoding
  Signal processing techniques (LTE, LTE/A, WiMAX)
  Signal processing for millimeter and Tera-Hz communication systems
  Signal processing for single-carrier, OFDM and OFDMA systems
  Signal processing for spread-spectrum, ultra-wideband systems
  Machine learning, and stochastic geometry-based

・Wireless Networks
  5G, 6G and beyond
  LTE, WiMAX, WMAN, and other broadband wireless networks
  WLAN, WPAN, and other home/personal networking technologies
  Underwater wireless networks
  Vehicular wireless networks

  OFDM and multi-carrier systems
  Multiple access techniques and air interfaces
  Millimeter wave and Terahertz communications
  Maritime, space and underwater communications
  Modulation, coding, and diversity techniques
  Performance analysis of wireless communication systems

・Image processing and wireless communications
  Image processing, and image communications
  Image detection using communication techniques
  Machine learning and image processing
  Image and Internet of Things

・Emerging Technologies, Applications, and Services Track
  Context and location-aware wireless services and applications

---SUBMISSION &amp; POLICIES---
Submitted papers (for both regular and special sessions) are subject to a blind
reviewed process handled by an international technical program committee.
An author of an accepted paper must register at full rate(member or non-member
of the IEEE) prior to uploading the camera ready version.
The maximum length of the camera-ready version is 6pages without incurring
additional page charges (maximum 1 additional page with over length page charge
of USD 100 if accepted). Papers exceeding 10 pages will not be accepted by EDAS.
Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible
for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the
conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at
the conference.
