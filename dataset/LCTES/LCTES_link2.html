Conference date and location: Mon 24 - Fri 28 June 2024 Copenhagen, Denmark

### Call for Papers
Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between
embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world.  Embedded systems
are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, large language
models, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these
emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design
requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore,
they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and
FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming
languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these
issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety,
and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints.

The 25th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools
and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2024) solicits papers presenting original
work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures
that help in overcoming these challenges.  Research papers on innovative
techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by
experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted
to <a href="https://lctes24.hotcrp.com/">https://lctes24.hotcrp.com/.</a>

### Important Dates
- Abstract submission - February 16, 2024
- Paper submission - February 23, 2024
- Paper notification - April 1, 2024
- Camera-ready paper submission - April 15, 2024
- Conference - June 24, 2024

### Paper Categories
- Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work.
- Poster and work-in-progress paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that
  are likely to trigger interesting discussions.
- Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by
  ACM. In addition, this year's LCTES will have **Distinguished Paper awards**
  selected from this year's accepted paper to recognise the outstanding work among
  all papers.

All accepted full papers will be invited to be published in a **special issue of
the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)**. A TECS publication
will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and
will undergo a separate review process.  Rejected full papers may have the option
to submit their work to the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL; 4 pages). IEEE
ESL submissions will undergo a separate review process.
