  <h1>SIGMOD 2024 CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS</h1>


<p>
Santiago, Chile, June 11-16, 2024,<a style="color:
#CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://2024.sigmod.org">
https://2024.sigmod.org</a> </p>
<p>
    

</p>

<p align="justify">
The PACMMOD issues of SIGMOD 2024 seek contributions in all aspects of data management research.  Authors of papers published in the PACMMOD issues of SIGMOD 2024 will be invited to present their work at the SIGMOD conference in June 2024.  The annual ACM SIGMOD conference is a leading international forum for data management researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.
</p>

<h3>NEW IN 2024</h3>

<p align="justify">
  </p><ul>
  <li style="color:Red;"><b> All authors are required to have a registered account with the submission site (CMT).</b><br>
  The submission system will not allow submission of papers that do not satisfy this requirement. </li>
  <li>Four paper submission deadlines:
January 15 (Round 1), April 15 (Round 2), July 15 (Round 3), October 15 (Round 4)
</li>
  <li>Submission website: <a style="color:
#CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2024">https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2024</a>
</li>
  <li>All Research Track submissions, including the special tracks, must be anonymized and at most 12 pages in length, plus an unlimited number of pages for citations.
</li>
  <li>Special Track submissions must include the special track name as a subtitle of the title, in parentheses.
</li>
  <li>Updated conflict of interest policy and conflict declaration on CMT. Note that each author is now required to enter individual domain and PC conflicts on the submission site.
</li>
  <li>Updated submission eligibility rules: Any rejected submissions to the final round of SIGMOD 2023 (October round) are not allowed to be resubmitted to Round 1 (January round) of SIGMOD 2024. However, such papers may be submitted to subsequent rounds (Rounds 2, 3, and 4).
</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
For all tracks, after the first review, one extra content page is allowed to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up
to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.</p>

<h3 id="tracks">TRACKS</h3>
<p align="justify">
 There are three research tracks in PACMMOD issues of SIGMOD 2024:
  </p><ul>
    <li><b>Regular Track</b><br>We invite the submission of original research contributions relating to all aspects of data management.</li>
    <li><b>Data Management for Data Science (DMDS) Special Track</b><br>We invite the submission of original data science research targeting the data life cycle of real applications, studying phenomena at scales, complexities, and granularities never before possible. This data life cycle encompasses databases/data management/data systems/data engineering often leveraging statistical, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methods and, in many instances, using massive and heterogeneous collections of potentially noisy datasets. Such papers are expected to focus on data-intensive components of data science pipelines; and solve problems in areas of interest to our community (e.g., data curation, optimization, performance, storage, systems). Submissions are expected to describe (a) deployed solutions to data science pipelines and/or (b) fundamental experiences and insights from evaluating real-world data science problems. We expect that the related systems and/or datasets (including possibly query logs) will be accessible for the data management research community in order to promote future research directions.</li>
    <li><b>Data-intensive Applications (DIA) Special Track</b><br>We invite the submission of papers describing applications, systems, and datasets (e.g. content, creation, quality), along with the underlying practical data management problems and related research challenges. These applications may stem from outside the core data management community (e.g., computer graphics, computer networking) or even from outside computer science (e.g., astronomy, genomics, healthcare), but have clearly demonstrated non-trivial data-centric challenges necessitating novel systems and technologies. Submissions may describe fundamental experiences and insights gained from deployment or detailed evaluation of data-intensive systems in particular application domains. We expect that the related systems and/or datasets (including possibly query logs) will be accessible for the data management research community in order to promote future research directions. </li>
  </ul> 
<p></p>
<p align="justify">
All research track papers
(including special track papers) are subject to double-anonymity requirement.</p>
<h3 id="topics">TOPICS OF INTEREST</h3>

SIGMOD welcomes submissions on inter-disciplinary work, as long as there are clear contributions to management of data.

</p><h3 id="dates">IMPORTANT DATES </h3>
<p align="justify">
New development for SIGMOD 2024: There are 4 submission rounds (January, April, July, and October). Authors of submissions with a revision decision will be given approximately one month to submit a revised version. While we strive to adhere to the published timeline, we note that author feedback and notification dates may vary slightly.  Submission deadlines are not expected to be altered.
</p>
<p align="justify">
As we have moved to quarterly deadlines, maintaining consistency is important, both to avoid confusion, and to better manage and plan the workload of the PC. We realize that deadlines may occasionally fall on holidays or weekends.  However, we note that holidays are not common across different countries and cultures, and there is variability in which days of the week are considered workdays.  We encourage authors to plan ahead and aim to submit a few days early if they wish to avoid a particular holiday or weekend.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE ON RESUBMISSION ELIGIBILITY:</b> Papers rejected in one round of SIGMOD 2024 are not allowed to be re-submitted in subsequent rounds of the same year.  Further, any rejected submissions to the final round of SIGMOD 2023 (October round) are not allowed to be resubmitted to Round 1 (January round) of SIGMOD 2024.  However, such papers may be submitted to subsequent rounds (Rounds 2, 3, and 4).

<p></p><h3 id="presentation">PRESENTATION AND DISSEMINATION</h3>
<p align="justify">
All accepted papers will be treated equally in the conference proceedings, which are the persistent record of the conference. Authors of all accepted papers will have an opportunity to disseminate their works in person as part of the conference program.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The rights of all ACM published authors are detailed at:<br>

</p>

<h3 id="proceedings">PROCEEDINGS AVAILABILITY</h3>
<p align="justify"> In addition to moving to a quarterly rolling submission and review process, the SIGMOD Executive Committee has decided to move to a model where accepted papers are published in a timely manner in an archival journal.</p>
 
<p align="justify">As a result, all accepted research and industrial track papers in SIGMOD, from SIGMOD 2023 onwards, will appear in the Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD), whose URL is <a style="color:
#CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod">https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod</a>. Other conference-related publications such as keynote talk abstracts, demonstration papers, tutorial abstracts, and invited industrial papers will also appear in the companion volume of PACMMOD. </p>

<p align="justify">We will provide more information on publication dates once the publication processes are ironed out.</p>



<!--
The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.  SIGMOD is working on the possibility of early publication of papers to avoid long delays between acceptance in the early rounds and the official publication. We will update this section in the future, as new information on this topic becomes available.

<!--
<br> Note that the official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

<h3 id="submission">SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</h3>
<p align="justify">
  All aspects of the submission
and notification process will be handled electronically. Submissions must
adhere to the paper formatting instructions. All papers will be judged for
quality and relevance. Submissions should be uploaded at:<br>
  <a style="color:
#CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2024">
https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2024</a>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Once the paper is submitted,
SIGMOD does not accept any changes in the title and/or authorship list, with
the rare exception of title changes requested as part of the revision request
by the Associate Editor.
</p>

<h3><a name="submissionpolicy">DUPLICATE SUBMISSIONS AND NOVELTY REQUIREMENT</a></h3>

<p align="justify">Following the <a style="color:
#CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions"> ACM guidelines</a> a research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2024 cannot be
under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including
conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered
for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a research paper to SIGMOD, you must
await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is
rejectedâor withdrawn at your requestâfrom SIGMOD. This restriction
applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial
overlap in scientific content and results.</p>

<p align="justify">To enforce this requirement, the high-level metadata of
submissions (title, abstract, list of authors), may be shared with the Program
Chairs / Editors of other conferences and journals.</p>

<p align="justify">Every research paper submitted to SIGMOD 2024 must present
substantial novel research not described in any prior publication. In this
context, a prior publication is (a) a paper of five pages or more, presented,
or accepted for presentation, at a refereed conference or workshop with
proceedings; or (b) an article published, or accepted for publication, in a
refereed journal. If a SIGMOD 2024 submission has overlap with a prior
publication, the submission must cite the prior publication (respecting the double
anonymity requirement), and clearly indicate which parts of the work appeared
in prior publications and which parts are novel to the current submission.</p>

<p align="justify"><i>Any violation of this policy will result in the immediate rejection of the submission, as well as in notification to the members of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the members of the SIGMOD PC, and the editors or chairs of any other forums involved.   </i>

<h3><a name="formatting">LENGTH, FILE TYPE, AND FORMATTING</a></h3>

<p></p><p align="justify">
Length for submitted papers: All submitted research papers must be formatted according to the instructions below. The main content of the paper must be no more than 12 pages in length for all Research Track papers, although we allow an unlimited number of pages for the bibliography. No appendix will be allowed.    </p><p align="justify">
    Length for revised and camera ready papers: For all SIGMOD Research track papers, authors are allowed one extra page to help address reviewer comments in the revised version. Therefore, the length of camera ready papers can be up to 13 pages (+ unlimited references).</p>
<p align="justify">
File type: Each research paper is to be
submitted as a single PDF file, formatted for 8.5" x 11" paper and no
more than 10 MB in file size. (Larger files will be rejected by the submission
site.) Submitted papers must print without difficulty on a variety of printers,
using Adobe Acrobat Reader. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure
that their submitted PDF file will print easily on simple default
configurations.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Formatting: Research papers must follow the 2-column ACM Proceedings Format, using either the <b>sample-sigconf.tex</b> or <b>Interim layout.docx</b> template provided at <a style="color: #CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a> for LaTeX (version 2e) or Word, respectively.

<b>Additional requirements for the Special Track papers: </b>The PDF submission needs
to contain the special track name as a subtitle of the title, in parentheses.</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>PACMMOD format:</b>
We note that accepted papers will need to be ported into the PACMMOD format for final publication.  
However, please do not use the PACMMOD format for submission.  
Submissions will continue to follow the ACM Proceedings Format for the remaining cycles of this year to maintain consistency.

<h3 id="inclusionanddiversity"> INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY IN WRITING
</h3>
<p align="justify">We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and
professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of
representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and
ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing
of not using language or examples that further the marginalization,
stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically
marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant

<h3><a name="chatgpt"> ACM POLICY ON AUTHORSHIP REQUIREMENTS</a></h3>
    <p align="justify">We follow the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">ACM policy on authorship requirements</a>.  Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: "Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain Â­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work."
    </p>

<h3 id="anonymity"> ANONYMITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL RESEARCH TRACK SUBMISSIONS
</h3>
<p align="justify">
Research track submissions (including special track submissions) are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.</p><ul>
<p align="justify">Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2024 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in <a style="color:
#CC6600; text-decoration: none;" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00177">(Snodgrass 2007)</a>: authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process. </p>

<p align="justify">PC members and referees, except the Associate Editors, who review the submission will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure anonymity of authorship from the PC members and referees, authors must at least do the following: </p>


<li> Authors' names and
affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the submission.
</li><li> Funding sources must not be
acknowledged anywhere in the submission.
</li><li> Research group members, or
other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the
submission.
</li><li> The paperâs file name must not identify
the authors of the submission.
</li><li> Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors' names in the submission's associated metadata. For
example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a
.dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship
could be inferred by looking into the PDF file.
</li></ul>

<p align="justify">To avoid compromising the double-anonymity requirement, we request that the authors refrain from publicizing and uploading versions of their submitted manuscripts to pre-publication servers, such as arXiv, and other online forums during the reviewing period. If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to SIGMOD.</p>


<p align="justify">
You must also use care in referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. For example, if you are Jane Smith, the following text gives away the authorship of the submitted paper:
</p><blockquote>
<i>
In our previous work [1, 2], we presented two algorithms for ... In this paper, we build on that work by ...
</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Bibliography</b><br>
<i>
[1] Jane Smith, "A Simple Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD
1997, pp. 1 - 10. <br>
[2] Jane Smith, "A More Complicated Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of
ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.<br>
</i></blockquote>

<p align="justify">
The solution is to reference one's past work in the third
person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same
time preserving anonymity:
</p><blockquote><i>
In previous work [1, 2], algorithms were presented for ... In this
paper, we build on that work by ...
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Bibliography</b><br>
<i>
[1] Jane Smith, "A Simple Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD
1997, pp. 1 - 10.<br>
[2] Jane Smith, "A More Complicated Algorithm for ...," Proceedings of
ACM SIGMOD 1998, pp. 34 - 44.<br>
</i></blockquote>

<p align="justify">
Despite the anonymity requirements, you should still include all relevant work of your own in the references, using the above style; omitting them could potentially reveal your identity by negation. However, self-references should be limited to the essential ones, and extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.
</p><p align="justify">
Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. The goal is to preserve anonymity while still allowing the reader to fully grasp the context (related past work, including your own) of the submitted paper. In past years, this goal has been achieved successfully by thousands of papers.
</p><p align="justify">
<i>It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.  </i>

</p><p align="justify">
<i>No exceptions will be made to
the double anonymity requirement for Research Track papers. If the authors of a submission feel that
double anonymity needs to be violated, for example to reveal the identity of a
system, they may consider submission to a SIGMOD track that does not impose a
double anonymity requirement, such as the Industry Track.</i></p>

<h3 id="artifacts">ARTIFACTS and REPRODUCIBILITY</h3>
<p align="justify">
SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.</p>

<p align="justify">
Please include a link with your materials in the text box provided in the submission form at the time of submission. For all Research Track submissions, the link and materials should preserve anonymity. For example this may be an anonymous GitHub repository. You may want to make sure that the link you provide is not indexed by search engines. On GitHub, you can do so by adding the following to the page head:</p>

<p align="center"> </p><center><xmp><meta name="robots" content="noindex"></xmp></center><p></p>

<p align="justify">
We recognize that at the time of submission authors focus on fine-tuning the paper, and so we expect this link to be live within two weeks from submission. Reviewers that may need to look at the materials will not do so earlier than that. We do not expect a fully polished submission in terms of automatically reproducing results, but rather a reasonably clean version of the state of the code when submitting the paper. Please, do not use a shortened link which traces who accesses it.</p>

<p align="justify">
In the event that you are not able to submit your code, data, scripts, and notebooks please explain in the text box provided in the submission form why this is the case.
</p>




<h3 id="conflicts">CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (Updated in 2024)</h3>
<p align="justify">During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paperâs authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the definition below. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Definition of Conflict of Interest:</b><i> A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when, and only when, one or more of the following conditions holds:
</i></p><ul><i>
<li>The PC member is a co-author of the paper.</li>
<li>The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past five years.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>The PC member has been a collaborator within the past five years.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>The PC member is or was the author's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
<li>The author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor, or post-doctoral advisor, no matter how long ago.</li>
<li>The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author.</li>
</i></ul>

<p align="justify">
<i><sup>1</sup>Short-term associations, such as summer internships do not constitute institutional COIs.  E.g., a student who interned at Microsoft should declare as conflicts any individuals in the group they worked with and other collaborators on their projects, but they should not declare a domain conflict with microsoft.com.
</i>
</p>
<p align="justify">
<i><sup>2</sup>Collaborations are indicated by prior co-authorships, shared grant funding, and close research relationships, even if those have not yet resulted in common publications. Publications (typically with a large set of authors) that fall outside the traditional sense of research collaborations (e.g., âThe Seattle Report on Database Researchâ, â Diversity and Inclusion Activities in Database Conferences: A 2021 Reportâ, etc.) do not in themselves constitute a COI.
</i>
</p>

<p align="justify">To identify any potentially spurious conflicts, PC members may be asked to confirm declared conflicts with submitting authors.
</p>


<p align="justify"><b>Conflict declaration on CMT:</b>
Conflicts will no longer be declared per submission.  Rather, each author is now responsible for entering their own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT.  You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''.  An author's declared conflicts will be automatically applied to all of their submissions.
</p>




<h3 id="review">REVIEWING PROCESS AND REVISIONS</h3>
<p align="justify">
<b>Number of reviews:</b> Each submission will first receive at least three reviews.  At the discretion of the AE and the PC chairs, additional reviews may be procured. </p>

<p align="justify"><b>Author Feedbacks:</b> Before the discussion phase starts between reviewers and decisions are made, authors will have a few days to read the reviews and submit optional brief feedback. The sole purpose of the author feedback is to clarify misunderstandings and factual errors through pointers to specific text in the submitted paper. As an example, a reviewer may have overlooked a part of the discussion in the paper and state that the paper fails to compare with a certain method; an example feedback will be of the form "see Section 2.4, paragraph 3". If no factual errors exist in the reviews, author feedback is not needed.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Revisions:</b> Some authors will be invited to submit a revised version of their paper. Authors will have one month to implement the revision items. The revision process is intended to be a constructive partnership between reviewers and authors. To this end, reviewers will be instructed to request revisions only in constructive scenarios with specific requests. In turn, authors bear the responsibility of attempting to meet those requests within the stated time frame, or of withdrawing the paper from submission. Common revision requests can include ''justify a crucial assumption'', ''present a real(istic) scenario where the defined problem occurs'', ''clean up notation'', ''tighten presentation'', ''compare against some relevant previous system'', ''show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or from a real system''. Revisions will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original. </p>

<p align="justify">
For all tracks, one extra content page is allowed after the first review to accommodate the requested revision items. The revised submission should include a cover letter (up to 4 pages) to summarize how the authors have addressed the requested revisions.  Authors are encouraged to highlight parts of their revised manuscripts that are edited in a different color to ease their identification by the reviewers.  </p>
