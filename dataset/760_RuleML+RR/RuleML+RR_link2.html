RuleML+RR 2024 is a leading international joint conference in the field of rule-based reasoning. One of the main goals of RuleML+RR is to build bridges between academia and industry in the area of semantic reasoning.

RuleML+RR 2024 aims to bring together rigorous researchers and inventive practitioners, interested in the foundations and applications of rules and reasoning. It provides a forum for stimulating cooperation and cross-fertilization between different communities focused on the research, development, and applications of rule-based systems. We are looking for high-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and Artificial Intelligence applications that involve rule-based representation and reasoning.

The RuleML+RR 2024 conference is part of the event “Declarative AI: Rules, Reasoning, Decisions, and Explanations” (https://2024.declarativeai.net) and is co-located with DecisionCAMP 2024 and the Reasoning Web Summer School. Apart from the main track, it features: 

* Rule Challenge (https://2024.declarativeai.net/events/ruleml-rr/rule-challenge),
* Doctoral Consortium (https://2024.declarativeai.net/events/ruleml-rr/doctoral-consortium),
* Industry Track (https://2024.declarativeai.net/events/ruleml-rr/industry-track),
* Project Networking Session (https://2024.declarativeai.net/events/ruleml-rr/networking-session)

*** Topics ***

RuleML+RR welcomes research from all areas of Rules and Reasoning. The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

* Ontologies / Semantic Web / Description Logics / Existential Rules
* Rules for AI and AI for Rules / Explainable AI based on Rules
* Rules and Reasoning / Logics
* Technical Aspects of Rule Systems / Rule Technology
* Rules and Interoperability
* System Descriptions, Applications and Experiences of Ontologies and Rules 

See the conference homepage for more details on the topics:

For each of these deadlines, a cut-off point of 23:59 AOE applies.

**Submission and Publication**

High-quality papers related to theoretical advances, novel technologies, and artificial intelligence applications concerning explainable algorithmic decision-making that involve rule-based representation and reasoning are solicited.

We accept the following submission formats for papers:

- Long papers (up to 15 pages in LNCS style including references)
- Short papers (up to 8 pages in LNCS style including references)

Long papers should present original and significant research and/or development results. Short papers should concisely describe general results or specific applications, systems, or position statements. All submissions must be prepared in Springer's LNCS style (http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html).

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with formal proceedings. Double submission to a workshop with informal proceedings is allowed. Papers put on arXiv are also allowed aslong as they are not refereed (i.e., formally reviewed by peers). 

Submissions to the RuleML+RR conference

- have the page limit of 15 (/8) pages including references
- are not anonymous
- can have additional material included as an external report (appendices to the submission are not permitted and a paper should be self-contained)

Papers should be written in English can be submitted using EasyChair:

https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rulemlrr2024 

The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notesin Computer Science series (LNCS) after the conference. Proceedings of the associated events will be published by CEUR. The best papers will be considered for special issues of the Theory and Practice of Logic Programming or the Transactions on Graph Data and Knowledge journals.

The main track best paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Harold BoleyDistinguished Paper Award 2024 and best student paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Best Student Paper Award 2024.

The best RuleML Challenge paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Best Rule Challenge Paper Award 2024. The best Doctoral Consortium paper will be awarded the RuleML+RR Best Doctoral Consortium Paper Award 2024.
