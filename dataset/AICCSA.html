The workshop is part of the 20th ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (IEEE AICCSA 2023),  4th  – 7th December, 2023, Giza, Egypt.


Scope

The quality and expenditure control in the health sector have become, in both developed and developing countries alike, the main objectives pursued by authorities. The digital transformation of the sector has shown promise to provide answers to these objectives and to overcome challenges of health services, particularly those linked to the ageing of the population, the increasing rates of chronic diseases and the personalisation of medicine. Indeed, the rapid spread of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the presence of the digital network anywhere and anytime, allow to improve quality of, often in short term, health services which provide personalised patient care, reduce the number and duration of hospital stays, enable continuous patient monitoring and conceive efficient and safe home care.

The recent development and employment of artificial intelligence and analysis techniques to exploit big data in healthcare to develop new improved disease surveillance methods, improve diagnosis and early disease detection, discover novel treatments, uncover new drug side effects or interactions, and design and study deployment of decision-making methods and IT solutions in order to improve performance and security of the patient pathway management, both, in and out the hospital. The recent challenges presented by COVID-19 are examples for the need to bringing the optimisation of healthcare functions and services to the maximum. Digital transformation, including developing novel IT innovations and disruptive approaches and employing ehealth services, provide one key solution to meeting these challenges.

Digital transformation, already underway in many countries, is defined, for a health organisation, as a process that employs fully integrated digital technologies into all of its activities in order to improve its performance. It is characterised not only by technical development, but also establishing a new way of working, an attitude, and a commitment for networked, global thinking, to improve health care by using ICT. Hence, it deeply transforms, at a rattling pace, the rules and ways of managing the health system and thus seeks to develop new innovative informatics solutions to enable, support as well as utilise this transformation.

As digital transformation of the health sector brings significant progress to the care system, it consequently requires major changes in the behaviour of the actors of the health system. Similar to any major change in norms and practices, this transition would also face reluctance, barriers and fears it can generate. As such, it imposes on hospital organisations a real problem in driving the change amongst their staff. Many employees may feel disoriented and overwhelmed by the new ways and practices. They may consider digital transformation as a risk and not an opportunity. In order for them to become engaged actors of this process, instead of being subjected to it, it is essential that health institutions integrate its collaborators and give them the means to master and be the drivers of this change.

To that purpose, both development of IT innovations and disruptive approaches, and introduction and deployment of IT solutions in healthcare environments, associated with education and training in digital health are fundamental prerequisites, not just for the wide- scale adoption but also for the effective use of e-health solutions and a key to the success of digital transformation in the health sector. Digital health education and training, for which the underlying body of knowledge is health informatics, should be directed to all kind of stakeholders involved in the health ecosystem and should be based on innovative educational methods and adapted to the profiles of these stakeholders.

The workshop will provide a research-rich environment to address the challenges and support the development of new novel and disruptive approaches paving the way towards improved public health and personalised medicine. Recent spread of COVID-19, in many countries, causing disastrous human-impacting events, and as one of the most challenging communicable and infectious diseases, research related to developing innovative solutions to improve early surveillance, detection, diagnosis or treatments are also encouraged.
It’s within the above scope that this workshop has been conceived to bring together researchers and practitioners to share research results, advancements and practical related experiences in this field.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
•	eHealth patient-centred solutions
•	Disruptive approaches to development of healthcare informatics solutions

PAPER SUBMISSION DETAILS

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research and application papers that are not being considered in other forums. Manuscripts will be limited to a maximum of 6 two- column pages (IEEE Proceeding style) including figures and references. Please follow the IEEE Conference Publishing Service (CPS) guidelines to prepare your papers.
Manuscripts should be prepared in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5" x 11" two-column format. All papers should be in PDF format, and submitted electronically at Paper Submission Link. A full paper must not exceed the stated length (including all figures, tables and references). Submitted papers must present original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines may be rejected without review. Also submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. Authors may contact the workshop Chair for further information or clarification.

All submissions are blind peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted papers will appear in the Conference Proceedings and be published by the IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services and be submitted to IEEE Xplore for inclusion.

Submitted papers must include original work, and must not be under consideration for another conference or journal. Submission of regular papers must not exceed 6 pages and must follow the IEEE paper format. Please include up to 7 keywords, complete postal and e- mail address, and fax and phone numbers of the corresponding author. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. Submitted papers that are deemed of good quality but that could not be accepted as regular papers will be accepted as short papers.
Authors of accepted papers are requested to sign the IEEE copyright form. The guidelines for authors can be found at IEEE Conference Publishing Services - Proceedings Author Forms.
