                    February 13, 2024, 23:59 AoE (<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Crypto+2024+submission+deadline&amp;iso=20240213T2359&amp;p1=3399" target="_blank">convert
                        to your time zone</a>).
                </div>

                <h5>Anonymity</h5>

                <p>Submissions must be anonymous with no author names, affiliations, or obvious references. The list of
                    authors is
                    requested separately on the submission form; it will be known to the co-chairs but not made
                    available to the rest of
                    the program committee unless the paper is accepted. Note that, per <a href="https://iacr.org/docs/author.pdf" target="_blank">IACR
                        policy</a>, the anonymity requirement does not preclude the authors from posting nonanonymized
                    versions of their
                    work online or talking about it.</p>

                <h5>Structure</h5>

                <p>The submission should begin with a title, a short abstract, and an introduction. There is no
                    requirement to include
                    keywords, but they may be supplied if helpful. The introduction should summarize the contributions
                    of the paper and
                    the relationship to existing work in a manner that is understandable to a general cryptographic
                    audience.</p>

                <h5>Formatting and Page Limits</h5>

                <p>The main body of the submission must be at most 30 pages long, followed by references (which do not
                    count towards the 30 page limit for the main body). Any amount of clearly marked
                    supplementary material may be supplied, either as an appendix to the main body of the paper or in
                    separate files;
                    however, reviewers are not required to read any supplementary material, and submissions are expected
                    to be
                    intelligible without it.</p>

                <p>Submissions must be prepared in LaTeX using the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank">Springer LNCS
                        format</a> (without modifying the LNCS default fonts, sizes, or margins) and submitted
                    electronically in PDF
                    format. Details on the Springer LNCS format can be obtained. All submissions must have page numbers
                    (e.g. using
                    LaTeX command <tt>\pagestyle{plain}</tt>). The use of BibTeX in conjunction with LNCS’s
                    bibliography style
                    <tt>splncs04.bst</tt> is strongly recommended; the use of <a href="https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/" target="_blank">CryptoBib</a> is
                    encouraged.
                </p>

                <div class="alert alert-danger">Submissions not meeting the above guidelines risk rejection without
                    consideration of
                    their merits.</div>

                <h5>Code and Data Artifacts</h5>

                <p>Supplementary materials may contain appropriately anonymized code or data artifacts, which the
                    reviewers may access
                    at their discretion during the paper review process. Alternatively, authors may include in their
                    paper a link to an
                    appropriately anonymized online repository; for example using <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/" target="_blank">this
                        tool</a> for anonymization of Github repositories. A separate artifact evaluation process will
                    occur for
                    accepted papers that wish to have their artifacts evaluated and made available on the IACR Artifact
                    Archive; a
                    separate <a href="callforartifacts.php">call for artifacts</a> details the submission instructions for that process.</p>

                <h5>Prior Reviews</h5>

                <p>If the submission was rejected from prior conferences, the authors are encouraged to include in their
                    supplementary
                    materials their responses to prior reviews, as described in the <a href="https://iacr.org/docs/author.pdf" target="_blank">Guidelines for Authors</a>.</p>

                <h5>Restrictions on PC Members</h5>

                <p>Program committee members are allowed to submit one paper if without student co-authors, two papers
                    if at least one
                    of them has a student co-author, and three papers if all of them have student co-authors. Program
                    committee
                    co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.</p>

                <h5>Exclusivity</h5>

                <p>Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or
                    has submitted in
                    parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. Accepted submissions
                    may not appear in
                    any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. IACR reserves the right to share information
                    about
                    submissions with other program committees to detect parallel submissions and the <a href="https://iacr.org/docs/irregular.pdf" target="_blank">IACR policy on irregular
                        submissions</a> will be
                    strictly enforced.
                </p>

                <h5>Publication and Presentation</h5>

                <p>The proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and
                    will be available
                    online. The authors of accepted papers will be expected to upload the IACR version (or the full
                    version) of their
                    papers to the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/" target="_blank">Cryptology ePrint Archive</a> and
                    will be required
                    to complete the
                    <a href="https://www.iacr.org/docs/copyright_form.pdf" target="_blank">IACR copyright assignment
                        form</a>. One of
                    the authors of
                    each accepted paper will be expected to present the paper in person at the conference (very rare
                    exceptions to this
                    rule can be made in case of visa problems). The presentations will be video recorded during the
                    event.
                </p>

                <h5>Conflicts of Interest</h5>

                <p>Authors, program committee members, and reviewers must follow the IACR Policy on Conflicts of
                    Interest, available
                    from
                    <a href="https://www.iacr.org/docs/conflicts.pdf" target="_blank">
                        https://www.iacr.org/docs/</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, the authors of each submission are asked during the
                    submission process to identify all members of the Program Committee who
                    have an automatic conflict of interest (COI) with the submission. A reviewer<sup>1</sup> has an
                    automatic COI with
                    an author if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        one is or was the thesis advisor to the other, no matter how long ago;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        they shared an institutional affiliation within the prior two
                        years<sup>2</sup>;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        they published two or more jointly authored works in the last three years<sup>3</sup>; or
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        they are immediate family members<sup>4</sup>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A reviewer has an automatic COI with a submission if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        the reviewer has an automatic COI with any of its authors;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the reviewer is authoring a paper (in submission<sup>5</sup> or in
                        preparation) whose content substantially overlaps with that of the
                        submission;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the reviewer has made a contribution to the submission (i.e. the
                        submission is the result of a collaboration that did not result in
                        the reviewer's authorship)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Any further COIs of importance should be separately disclosed. It is
                    the responsibility of all authors to ensure correct reporting of COI
                    information. Submissions with incorrect or incomplete COI information
                    may be rejected without consideration of their merits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    COIs are not restricted to automatic ones, others
                    being possible. COIs beyond automatic COIs could involve financial,
                    intellectual, or personal interests. Examples include closely
                    related technical work, cooperation in the form of joint projects
                    or grant applications, business relationships, close personal
                    friendships, instances of personal enmity. Full transparency is of
                    utmost importance, authors and reviewers must disclose to the
                    chairs or editor any circumstances that they think may create bias,
                    even if it does not raise to the level of a COI. The editor or
                    program chair will decide if such circumstances should be treated
                    as a COI.

                            the same location/campus of the same company/university. It does
                            not include separate universities of the same system nor distant

                            papers and books, whether formally published or just posted online,
                            resulting from collaboration on a scientific problem. It usually

                            revisions) is the relevant date. Multiple versions of a paper
                            (conference, ePrint, journal) count as a single paper.
