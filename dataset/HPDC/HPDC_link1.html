<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
The ACM International Symposium on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (HPDC) is the premier annual conference for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high-performance computing. 
	 </p>
	 <p>The 32nd HPDC is part of the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC) and will be held in Orlando, Florida, June 16-23, 2023.
	 </p>

<h3>Scope and Topics</h3>

	<p>
Submissions are welcomed on high-performance parallel and distributed computing topics including but not limited to: clouds, clusters, grids, big data, massively multicore, and extreme-scale computing systems. Submissions presenting new open-source tools or data are encouraged. Experience reports of operational deployments that present novel insights for future research on HPDC applications and systems are also welcome.
	</p>
	<p>
	 	In the context of high-performance parallel and distributed computing, the topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

	</ul>

<h3>Paper Submission Categories</h3>
		<p>
			<em>Submissions can be made in one of the following two categories: (1) regular papers, or (2) open-source tools or data papers.</em> The primary focus of "regular papers" should be to describe new research ideas supported by experimental implementation and evaluation of the proposed research ideas. The primary focus of "open-source tools or data" should be to describe the design, development, and evaluation of new open-source tools or novel data sources/products. Submissions in the "regular papers" category are also encouraged to open-source their software, data, and hardware artifacts.

		</p>

		<p>
		<strong>Authors are required to indicate the category of the paper as a part of the submitted manuscript's title.</strong> The last line of the title should indicate the paper type by using one of the two phrases (1) Paper Type: Regular, or (2) Paper Type: Open-source tools or data.
		</p>

		<p>
		All submissions in the open-source tools or data category may use the maximum allowed number of pages, as is the case with regular papers. However, papers in the open-source tools or data papers category of shorter length are welcome, if the contributions can be well articulated and substantiated. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards in terms of novelty, scientific value, demonstrated usefulness, and potential impact on the field. The nature of the contribution differs between the two categories (new research idea vs. new open-source tool or data) and papers will be evaluated based on the intended nature of the contribution, as declared by the chosen paper category at the time of the submission. The chosen category at the time of the submission can not be changed after the submission deadline.
		</p>

	<h4 style="color: blue">Suggested format for Introduction section</h4>
		<p>
		<em>Authors are encouraged (but not required) to structure their introduction section of the paper in the following format (as subsections or headings).</em> The suggested length is a maximum of two pages for this format.
		</p>

		<ol class="callpaper">
			<li><strong> Motivation.</strong>Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide (quantitative) support to motivate the specific problem the paper aims to address.</li>
			<li><strong>Limitation of state-of-art approaches.</strong>Briefly review the most relevant and most recent prior work. Clearly articulate the limitations of prior work and how your approach addresses those limitations. A more detailed discussion should be reserved for the related work section. But, this section should be sufficient to help readers recognize the novelty of your approach.</li>
			<li><strong>Key insights and contributions.</strong>Briefly articulate the major insights that enable your approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance the state-of-the-art. Describe the key ideas of your approach and design. List the key contributions including empirical results and improvement over prior work as applicable.</li>
			<li><strong>Limitations of the proposed approach.</strong>Almost all scientific contributions have limitations and scope for improvement. Clearly articulate the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
		Please note this suggested format is not a requirement for submission and authors have the flexibility to choose how they articulate their contributions. We hope that this structured format achieves two purposes: (1) helps authors state their contributions clearly and concisely, and (2) allows reviewers to judge the contributions more objectively. Authors will not be penalized for not following this format.
		</p>

		
<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
	<p>
	Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most 11 double column pages in PDF format, excluding references. Accepted papers will have the flexibility to use an additional page in the camera-ready version to incorporate feedback from the reviewers. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Papers should be formatted in the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Proceedings Style</a> and submitted via the HotCRP submission website. Papers should use the double column format (in Latex this can be done by using the ‘sigconf’ class as follows \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}) Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or journal. The author list must be removed for double-blind review.
	</p>
	<p>
	We recognize that time-constrained rebuttal periods can be challenging for some members of our HPDC community. Also, uniformly ensuring high quality of the rebuttal component for all papers is difficult due to time constraints. Therefore, there will be <strong> NO rebuttal or revision phase</strong>, which will shorten the review period and provide feedback to authors quickly. 
	</p>
	<p>
	To promote fair and equitable reviewing, HPDC will use <strong>a double-blind review process</strong>. Please refer to “Anonymizing Submissions” for detailed guidelines. Research has shown that single-blind reviewing can disadvantage authors from under-represented groups. Guidance for anonymizing submissions is described below.
	</p>

<!--
	<p><strong>Reviewing for HPDC 2022 will be double-blind.</strong></p>

<h3>Anonymizing Submissions</h3>
	<p>
		HPDC will use double-blind reviewing this year. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names.
	</p>

	<p>
		Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. In some cases, it is not credible to refer to your related work in the third person. For example, your submission may extend a previous workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently under review at HPDC or another venue. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your HPDC submission and the other work, but you should cite the other work anonymously and e-mail the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.
	</p>

	<p>
		If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to evaluate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution.
	</p>

	<p>
		All tool/data papers should also adhere to the double-blind submission policy. If the described tool/dataset framework is already widely used by the research community, consider describing the framework using a different name and not sharing the open-source code repository in the paper.
	</p>

<h3>Optional Supplemental Information about Revisions</h3>
	<p>
		Authors can upload a document listing the improvements made in response to the reviews received from a previously submitted version. Authors have three options: (1) not provide this information, (2) provide this information but the visibility is set to the PC chairs only, and (3) provide this information and the visibility is set to all the reviewers. The intent is to improve the efficiency of the over-burdened review process and benefit the authors who faithfully revise the paper to incorporate feedback from previous reviewers. Additional implementation details related to this policy are available on the submission website.
	</p>

<h3>Confidential Information</h3>
	<p>
		Papers containing information that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will not be considered for review.
	</p>


<h3>arXiv Submission Policy </h3>
	<p>
		Please note that having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HPDC 2022. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).
	</p>

<h3>Author list after acceptance </h3>
	<p>
		Please note that the author list cannot be changed after acceptance.
	</p>

<h3>Conflict of Interest Declaration </h3>
	<p>
		At the time of submission, all authors must indicate their conflict of interest with the PC members. A conflict of interest may be institutional, collaborative, or personal. Please see detailed guidelines about how to accurately declare a conflict of interest on the submission website.
	</p>

<h3>Ethical Guidelines</h3>
	<p>
		If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about the responsible disclosure. Overall, as appropriate and relevant, the paper should follow the ethical principles and not alter the security/privacy/equality expectations of the associated human users.
	</p>

<h3>Inclusive Description of Research Contributions</h3>
	<p>
		Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

	Papers containing information that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will not be considered for review.
	</p>

<h3>arXiv Submission Policy </h3>
	<p>
	A prior version of a paper shared on arXiv does not prohibit authors from submitting to HPDC 2023. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and are not considered as formal publications. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not been published in conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission).
	</p>
	<p>
	Authors should not upload or revise an arXiv version of an HPDC submission during the review period (from the submission deadline until author notification).
	</p>

<h3>Author List After Acceptance</h3>
	<p>
	The author list cannot be changed after acceptance.
	</p>

<h3>Conflict of Interest Declaration</h3>
	 <p>
	 At the time of submission, all authors must indicate their conflict of interest with the PC members. A conflict of interest may be institutional, collaborative, or personal. Please see detailed guidelines about how to accurately declare a conflict of interest on the submission website.
	 </p>

<h3>Ethical Guidelines</h3>
	 <p>
	 If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about responsible disclosure. Overall, as appropriate and relevant, the paper should follow ethical principles and not alter the security/privacy/equality expectations of the associated human users.
	 </p>

<h3>Inclusivity</h3>
	<p>
	HPDC is committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Staying at the forefront of high performance and distributed computing requires the contributions and perspectives of people with diverse backgrounds. The conference aims to foster an inclusive environment that values the contributions of the entire community regardless of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion, academic affiliation, or seniority.
	</p>
	<p>
	We ask that authors make their research contribution inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, and engaging users from diverse backgrounds if the research is qualitative. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.
	</p>
	<p>
	All attendees are expected to abide by the HPDC Code of Conduct.
	</p>
