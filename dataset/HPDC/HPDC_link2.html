<h6 id="categories">Paper Submission Categories</h6>
<p> Submissions to HPDC can be made in one of the following two categories: (1) regular papers, or (2)
open-source tools and data papers.
The primary focus of regular papers should be to describe new research ideas supported by experimental
implementation and evaluation
of the proposed research ideas. The primary focus of open-source tools and data should be to describe the
design, development, and
evaluation of new open-source tools or novel data sources. Submissions in the regular papers category are
also strongly encouraged
to open-source their software or hardware artifacts.
<br><br>
The authors are required to indicate the category of the paper as a part of the submitted manuscript's
title. The last line of the title
should indicate the paper type by using one of the two phrases (1) Paper Type: Regular, or (2) Paper Type:
Open-source tools and data paper.
<br><br>
Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards in terms of novelty, scientific
value, demonstrated usefulness,
and potential impact on the field. The chosen category at the time of the submission can not be changed
after the submission deadline.
</p>


<br>
<h6 id="guidelines">Submission Guidelines</h6>
<p> Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most 11 pages in PDF format, excluding references.
Accepted papers will have the flexibility
to use an additional page in the camera-ready to incorporate feedback from the reviewers. Papers should be
formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style
(using sigconf from <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>)
and submitted via the conference submission website. Submitted papers must be original work that has not
appeared in and is not under consideration
for another conference or a journal.
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="anonymization">Anonymizing Submissions</h6>
<p> HPDC uses double-blind reviewing. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by
implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).
The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names.
<br><br>
Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would
make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission
in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other
piece of related work. In some cases, it is not credible
to refer to your related work in the third person. For example, your submission may extend a previous
workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently
under review at HPDC or another venue. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your
HPDC submission and the other work, but you should cite
the other work anonymously and e-mail the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.
<br><br>
If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution, you should refer to the system
anonymously but describe the properties of the system
that are needed to evaluate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize
that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer
to identify your institution. Tool/data papers should also adhere to the double-blind submission policy. If
the described tool/dataset framework is already widely
used by the research community, consider describing the framework using a different name and not sharing the
open-source code repository in the paper.
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="confidentiality">Confidential Information</h6>
<p> Papers containing information that is subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) will not be considered for
review.
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="arxiv">arXiv Submission Policy</h6>
<p> Please note that having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HPDC 2024. arXiv
papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as
formal publications and hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv
papers that have not formally appeared in previous
conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the
double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged
to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different
title in the submission and do not upload/revise the arXiv
version during the review period after the submission deadline).
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="authlist">Author List After Acceptance</h6>
<p> Please note that the author list cannot be changed after acceptance.
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="conflict">Conflict of Interest Declaration</h6>
<p> At the time of submission, all authors must indicate their conflict of interest with the PC members. A
conflict of interest may be institutional, collaborative,
or personal. Please see detailed guidelines about how to accurately declare a conflict of interest on the
submission website.
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="policy">ACM Policy on Authorship</h6>
<p> Please refer to the ACM Policy on Authorship for all other guidelines. The frequently asked questions page
(<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions">https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions</a>)
provides policies on the use of generative
AI tools in preparing manuscripts.
<br><br>
By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors
are subject to all ACM Publications Policies,
including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged
violations of this policy or any ACM Publications
Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other
potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.
<br><br>
Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process
for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in
ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published
authors. The collection process has started and
will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure
proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community
efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

<h6 id="suggestions">Suggestions for Document Preparation for Authors</h6>
<h6><b>Formatting the Introduction Section</b></h6>
<p> HPDC authors are encouraged to structure their introduction section of the paper in the following format (as
subsections or headings).
</p><ol type="I">
<li><b>Motivation.</b> Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide (quantitative) support to
motivate the specific problem your submission is solving
</li><li><b>Limitation of state-of-art approaches.</b> Briefly review the most relevant and most recent prior
works. Clearly articulate the limitations of prior works
and how your approach breaks away from those limitations. A more detailed discussion should be reserved
for the related work section. But, this section should be
sufficient to help readers recognize the novelty of your approach
</li><li><b>Key insights and contributions.</b> Briefly articulate the major insights that enable your approach
or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of
these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Describe the key ideas of your approach and
design. List the key contributions including flagship empirical
results and improvement over the prior art as applicable
</li><li><b>Experimental methodology and artifact availability.</b> Clearly specify the key experimental /
simulation infrastructure and methodological details.
Support the experimental methodology choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works
have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology).
Include a line to indicate whether the software/hardware artifact will be available upon acceptance
</li><li><b>Limitations of the proposed approach.</b> Almost all scientific contributions have limitations and
scope for improvement. Clearly articulate all the major
limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions
made in the paper.
</li></ol>
Please note this suggested format is not a requirement for submission, and authors will not be penalized for
using a different format.
<p>
<br>
</p><h6 id="ethical">Ethical Considerations</h6>
<p> If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about the
responsible disclosure to the relevant entity. Overall,
as appropriate and relevant, the paper should follow the ethical principles and not alter the
security/privacy/equality expectations of the associated human users.
</p>
<br>
<h6 id="inclusivity">Inclusive Description of Research Contributions </h6>
<p> Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider
using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that
are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a
survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper
accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.
