<h3>Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2023</h3>

<p><strong>We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format</strong>, but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2- column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.</p>

<p><strong>Revised Papers from Prior Submission:</strong> To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2023 paper submission process.</p>

<li>UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, please consider papers in the range of ~7,500-10,000 words.

<h3>Additional Notes</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format</strong>, but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2- column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template.</li>
  <li>We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference.</li>
  <li>We will also use a two-week rebuttal period for papers (Thursday, May 25 to Thursday, June 8, 2023). Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Papers Co-chairs as much as possible.</li>
  <li>The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. The video is due on Friday, April 7, 2023.</li>
  <li><strong>Accessibility is a key concern for the UIST 2023 Program Chairs</strong>. We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible and will allow 6 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles for making your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will overall help increase the quality of the conference and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. These additional materials are due on Tuesday, April 11, 2023. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2023 Accessibility Chairs by emailing <a href="mailto:accessibility2023@uist.org">accessibility2023@uist.org</a> and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the April 11, 2023 deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/">SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission</a> which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/video-guide/">SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos</a>, which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.</li>

<h2 id="posters">Posters</h2>

<p>Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work or work that is still in progress, and work that is already presented in other venues but to share more with the UIST community.</p>

<p>Posters are non-archival, and will be more lightly reviewed (curated) than papers.</p>

<h2 id="demos">Demos</h2>

<p>Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR and large interactive installations.</p>

<p>All demo submissions go through a rigorous curation process. The demo chairs will announce recommendations for presentation formats, logistics and provide early access for technical setup before the conference.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow" target="_blank">We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow</a>.</li>
<li>
For <strong>LaTeX authors</strong>, submissions should be made using the double-column format (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uist.acm.org/2023/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf">example PDF</a>) using <code>\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}</code>.
</li>
<li>
For <strong>Word authors</strong>, submissions should be made using either the double-column format (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uist.acm.org/2023/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx">submission template</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uist.acm.org/2023/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf">example PDF</a>) or the single-column template (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uist.acm.org/2023/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx">submission template</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://uist.acm.org/2023/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf">example PDF</a>).
</li>
<li>
We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF.
<strong>We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. </strong>
</li>
<br>
<li>
<b>Floor Plan</b>
</li>
<li>
The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup.
</li>
<li>
This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue.

<p><strong>(1) Regular demo submission </strong>: authors are welcome to submit a demo abstract (approx. 2 pages), which will result in the abstract being included in the ACM digital library adjunct proceedings. This is sometimes relevant to reflect differences between paper and demo, e.g., changes in the list or order of authors.
</p>
<p><strong>(2) Fast track </strong>: Paper authors can indicate in their demo submission that they want to submit a fast track demo. In that case, no demo abstract is required. However, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan).

<h2 id="workshops">Workshops</h2>

<p>Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions the day before the paper track begins (i.e., workshops will happen on Sunday). Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as discussions, demonstrations, brainstormings, and prototyping, in combination with talks and keynotes. Workshops activities should target an audience of approximately 20 participants. All workshop participants will be required to register for the main conference, and there will be an additional fee to attend workshops to cover the additional logistical expenses.</p>

<p>Given space limitations, participants will need to apply by, e.g., answering a few open-ended questions with short answers, to participate; workshop organizers cannot require a position paper or similar longer submission. Similarly, there should be no expectation that workshop participants will submit their own previously published works to attend a workshop.
Workshop descriptions should include a clear scope, a proposed format, a preliminary agenda, and intended audience, and how you will facilitate audience interaction with organizers and each other.
These workshop descriptions are non-archival but can be included in the ACM DL adjunct proceedings in the same way posters’ extended abstracts are, if the organizers wish. Submissions will be more lightly reviewed than papers by an external jury.</p>

<h2 id="visions">Visions</h2>

<p>Back for its sixth year, UIST Visions is a venue for forward-thinking ideas to inspire the community and to project the UIST community as thought leaders in technical HCI. The goal is thus to propose new research directions rather than to report on existing research. Proposals will be reviewed based on novelty and relevance, and how provocative the ideas are. The author should aim to start a meaningful and well-informed discussion about future directions for computer-human interfaces and interaction techniques. Appropriate issues might be: future trends, foundational technologies that we need to make progress on, significant, compelling problems that the community might address, something that is missing, or an alternative perspective on what we do.</p>

<h2 id="doctoral-symposium">Doctoral Symposium</h2>

<p>The UIST Doctoral Symposium provides a unique opportunity for Ph.D. students to interact with established academic and industry researchers in the UIST community. Students can receive both feedback on technical aspects of their research as well as mentoring about different career options. The range of topics appropriate for the Doctoral Symposium is the same as the topics covered in the UIST Technical Papers program. Participants will be selected based on their anticipated contributions to the breadth and depth of the intellectual discussions at the Symposium. The Doctoral Symposium will be held in-person on Sunday, October 29, 2023 at the conference venue. There will also be a dinner for all panelists and student attendees of the Symposium.</p>

<p>The UIST SIC is your opportunity to shine and impress the world with your creative ideas! Participants will demo their work during the conference program, and contest winners will be announced during the conference. A jury composed of senior UIST community members will select one team to receive the SIC jury award. On top of that, conference attendees will get a chance to vote for their favorite teams in the People’s Choice category.
Each selected team will have access to LLM API usage, which is made possible through our generous sponsor Anthropic AI.</p>

<h3>UIST 2023 SIC Challenge: Beyond Words</h3>

<p><img src="/2023/assets/images/sic-3.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Your goal is to design and implement a novel interactive system, utilizing the LLM API provided to you. This system should leverage LLMs, and you may incorporate any other prototyping resources available. This year, we encourage participants to be innovative and think outside the box when integrating LLMs into interactive systems. Specifically, we encourage teams to explore novel use cases or applications of LLMs, such as those that incorporate different input/output modalities—exploring how LLMs can interact with audio, images, videos, etc., and broadening design possibilities.</p>

<p>To successfully address this challenge, you need to figure out what task(s) you want your system to support, and what interaction(s) you want your system to enable. Your system should motivate the use case and articulate a clear set of assumptions on how it will benefit users. Finally, your system does not have to be limited to one user— ideas that involve well-executed, multi-user, simultaneous interactions are often crowd favorites at UIST! We favor radical ideas that showcase fresh angles and novel uses of LLMs in interactive systems. We also encourage you to think about how you can connect LLMs to your own research. You will submit a video of your project demo by October 25th, and demonstrate your idea live at the in-person UIST event on October 29th - November 1st. Your video will be uploaded and shared on the official ACM SIGCHI YouTube channel (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMYAQzzQ_PI&amp;list=PLqhXYFYmZ-Vccj_oHapHyOZBEi3yI9OAb&amp;ab_channel=ACMSIGCHI">see UIST 2022 SIC videos</a>).</p>

<h3>Anthropic Claude API</h3>

<p><img src="/2023/assets/images/sic-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>This year, we’ll provide selected teams with access to the Anthropic Console. The Anthropic’s console provides access to LLM models with unique features.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One of the strongest LLM models: strong performance in code understanding/generation and quantitative reasoning (e.g., solving math problems) and scores well in exams such as the GRE and Bar</li>
  <li>Long context support of up to 100,000 tokens - useful for processing very long documents (e.g., hundreds of pages, books)</li>
  <li>Claude API includes Instant versions of the model designed for very fast responses</li>
</ul>

<p>Logging into the Anthropic console provides access to the web-based chat GUI which allows for fast and easy experimentation. The console also allows for the creation of API keys for integration into external systems and applications. API keys support unlimited queries but may be subject to a rate limit. Use of the Anthropic must adhere to the Acceptable Use Policy (<a href="https://console.anthropic.com/legal">https://console.anthropic.com/legal</a>).</p>

<p>The API can be queried with standard REST requests, and documentation and API reference are available online (<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs">https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs</a>). Anthropic provides example code for Python and Typescript (<a href="https://github.com/anthropics">https://github.com/anthropics</a>) and example applications to illustrate API usage.</p>

<p>We highly suggest incorporating any other software or hardware available at your disposal, to make more innovative and compelling projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any additional APIs you want to integrate (object detection, OCR, speech recognition)</li>
  <li>Any additional devices you want to use (gesture control, camera, robotic arm).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you consider integrating various I/O modalities with LLMs, you can use tools to transform these modalities into text or generate them based on texts. For instance, you could employ image captioning and object recognition to convert images or videos into text that LLMs can understand. Additionally, there are a growing number of open-sourced AI models that combine various modalities, which you can consider using in your system. For example, the <a href="https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/blip-2/">BLIP-2</a> and <a href="https://llava-vl.github.io/">LLaVA</a> models for image-to-text processing; <a href="https://openai.com/research/clip">CLIP</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP">CLAP</a> for joint embedding spaces of text-image and text-audio, respectively.</p>

<p>To assist the students in developing their applications, we (the SIC chairs) will provide technical support if they have any questions.</p>

<h4>Application Areas and Design Space</h4>
<p>You can build and design your system in many configurations, which affords the exploration of numerous design primitives. The primary requirements are to utilize the provided Claude API and to ensure that users can interact with the system in a meaningful way. With these requirements in mind, you may focus on one or more application areas. Below, we have listed some example application areas and corresponding existing works for inspiration.</p>

<h4>Logistics</h4>
<p>Team members from selected proposals will be given an Anthropic account that allows access to a chat interface and API keys, which can be integrated into custom applications. Anthropic’s website and GitHub repositories contain documentation and example code that could be useful for development. Teams are encouraged to open source their efforts, and even build on each other’s work. To get you moving fast, we will also provide a list of tutorials and mentoring sessions to ensure you have everything you need to make your vision a reality!</p>

<h4>Ethics and Broader Impact Statement</h4>
<p>In our commitment to responsible innovation, all proposals must include an Ethics and Broader Impact statement. Authors submitting proposals must follow the <a href="https://nips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines">NeurIPS Ethics Guidelines</a>. In particular, “whenever there are risks associated with the proposed methods, methodology, application or data collection and data usage, authors are expected to elaborate on the rationale of their decision and potential mitigations.” We ask the authors to reflect on the potential ethical dimensions of their project at its inception. This statement should be a concise exploration of potential ethical concerns, biases, and societal implications that the project could raise. Additionally, authors should describe how they plan to mitigate any potential negative outcomes. For detailed writing guide, please read <a href="https://medium.com/@GovAI/a-guide-to-writing-the-neurips-impact-statement-4293b723f832">A Guide to Writing the NeurIPS Impact Statement</a>.

<p>Being an SV will give you a chance to attend the premier forum for innovations in human-computer interfaces and network with the leaders in the field! At its core, the student volunteer experience is about making connections, both with your fellow volunteers and with more senior researchers. Whether it’s helping out with Q&amp;A after a talk for a researcher you look up to, working on a task directly with members of the organizing committee, or even helping someone check-in while working at the registration desk, there are so many opportunities to make connections that can have a true impact on your career. Not to mention the free conference registration and SV T-shirt!
We are happy to report that we plan on continuing the “rockstar” Q&amp;A sessions with senior researchers; these will most likely be held virtually the week following the conference.</p>

<p>If you are a UIST Student Volunteer, you get:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free conference registration</li>
  <li>Exclusive SV “rockstar” Q&amp;A sessions with senior faculty and researchers</li>
  <li>Access to a tight SV community</li>
  <li>A free UIST 2023 SV T-shirt</li>
  <li>The chance to closely work together with both presenters and the conference organizing committee</li>
</ul>

<h3>Logistics and Duties </h3>

<p>Our goal is to make sure SVs can attend the sessions that they are interested in. In 2023, we expect to have around 35 SVs who will work approximately 14 hours before or during the conference.</p>

<p>SVs will do a mix of tasks before and during the conference. Any hours spent doing pre-conference tasks will count towards your total SV hours. Some pre-conference tasks may need to be done several weeks before the conference begins; please indicate your availability to do pre-conference tasks on the lottery questionnaire and we will try to accommodate everyone’s preferences as best as possible.</p>

<p>UIST 2023 is intended to be a fully in-person conference (see <a href="/2023/attending/">Attending</a>).
Most SV tasks will be in person and we expect all SVs to attend the conference in person.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for applying! We look forward to seeing you at UIST 2023!!</p>

<p>The UIST Lasting Impact Award was established in 2003 to recognize UIST papers that have had a long-lasting influence on the field of user interface software and technology. The impact can be in terms of new research directions, wide acceptance in industry, or large societal impact.
The list of previous recipients is available at <a href="https://uist.acm.org/2023/archive/#lasting-impact">this link</a>.</p>

<p>This year, for the first time, we are issuing an open call to the community for nominations to this award. To nominate a paper, send an email to <a href="mailto:lastingimpact2023@uist.org">lastingimpact2023@uist.org</a> with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name, email address and position of the nominator</li>
  <li>The reference of the nominated paper (with the link to the ACM Digital Library)</li>
  <li>One sentence that describes the paper’s lasting impact (15 words max)</li>
  <li>A nomination letter explaining why this paper should receive the award (250 words max)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nominated papers must have been published at UIST 2013 or earlier. A person can nominate at most one paper per year. Authors cannot nominate their own papers. The committee will consider nominated papers along with other eligible papers identified by the committee.</p>

<p>The deadline for nomination is Monday, August 28 at midnight Anywhere-on-Earth (AOE) time.</p>

<p>The winning paper will be announced at the UIST 2023 conference in San Francisco this fall.</p>
