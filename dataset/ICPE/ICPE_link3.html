To: &lt;seworld@sigsoft.org&gt;

The SPEC Kaivalya Dixit Distinguished Dissertation Award
&lt;<a href="https://research.spec.org/awards/">https://research.spec.org/awards/</a>&gt; is an annual award that aims to
recognize outstanding doctoral dissertations within the scope of the SPEC
Research Group in terms of scientific originality, scientific significance,
practical relevance, impact, and presentation.

The winning dissertation
&lt;<a href="https://research.spec.org/awards/past-winners/2023/">https://research.spec.org/awards/past-winners/2023/</a>&gt; "AI and Co-Simulation
Driven Resource Management in Fog Computing Environments" was authored by
Shreshth Tuli from Imperial College London, under the supervision of
Professors Nicholas R. Jennings and Giuliano Casale. The selection
committee was impressed with the proposal to deliver QoS management
algorithms for Fog computing by coupling deep neural networks (DNN) models
at runtime with a live digital twin (co-simulator) of the Fog
infrastructure that acts as a data generator to fine-tune the DNNs whenever
the predictions are observed to lower in confidence. The combination of DNN
and co-simulator was shown in the thesis to be capable of tackling hard
scheduling and fault-tolerance problems that arise in the Fog.

The award is to be presented at the 15th ACM/SPEC International Conference
on Performance Engineering (ICPE) &lt;<a href="https://icpe2024.spec.org/">https://icpe2024.spec.org/</a>&gt; scheduled to
be held in London in May 2024.

Given the high quality of dissertations nominated for this award, the
committee decided to publicly recognize another dissertation as Runner-Up,
"Performance Engineering of Serverless Applications and Platforms" authored
by Dr. Simon Eismann, of Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg, under the
supervision of Prof. Samuel Kounev.

The award selection committee for 2023 was chaired by Prof. Cristina L.
Abad of ESPOL University in Ecuador, and consisted of the following members:

   - Varsha Apte, IIT Bombay, India
   - Valeria Cardellini, Università degli Studi di Roma "Tor Vergata", Italy
   - David Daly, MongoDB, USA
   - Anshul Gandhi, Stony Brook University, USA
   - Klaus Lange, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), USA
   - Arif Merchant, Google, USA
   - Evgenia Smirni, William and Mary, USA
   - Marco Vieira, University of Coimbra, Portugal
   - Jan Vitek, Charles University, Czech Republic

The SPEC Kaivalya Dixit Distinguished Dissertation Award was established in
2011 to recognize outstanding dissertations within the scope of the SPEC
Research Group. Contributions of interest span the design of metrics for
system evaluation as well as the development of methodologies, techniques
and tools for measurement, load testing, profiling, workload
characterization, dependability and efficiency evaluation of computing
systems. Dissertations defended between October 2022 and September 2024
will be eligible to be nominated for the 2024 award (a thesis can be
nominated only once).

Subject: [SEWORLD] Call-for-Nominations: SPEC Kaivalya Dixit Distinguished
         Dissertation Award 2023
To: &lt;seworld@sigsoft.org&gt;

The SPEC Kaivalya Dixit Distinguished Dissertation Award aims to recognize
outstanding doctoral dissertations in the field of computer benchmarking,
performance evaluation, and experimental system analysis in general.
Nominated dissertations will be evaluated in terms of scientific originality,
scientific significance, practical relevance, impact, and quality of the
presentation.

The SPEC Research Group promotes research in quantitative system
evaluation and analysis both with classical performance metrics - such as
response time, throughput, scalability and efficiency, as well as other
extra-functional system properties included under the term dependability -
such as availability, reliability, and security. Contributions of interest
span the design of metrics for system evaluation as well as the development
of methodologies, techniques and tools for measurement, load testing,
profiling, workload characterization, dependability and efficiency evaluation
of computing systems.

The winner will receive $1000, which will be awarded at the ACM/SPEC
International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE 2024).

Nomination Guidelines

A nomination consists of one PDF file less than 20MB that must include the
following information in this order:

A nomination letter with the name of the student, the title of the
dissertation, the institution where the dissertation was defended, and the
date of the defense. The nomination letter should outline the outstanding
contributions of the dissertation and should not exceed 2 pages (letter size)
using 11 point font.
A C.V. of the nominee (up to three pages) that clearly marks all
publications/technical reports that are included in the dissertation.
The dissertation itself, including a one-page extended abstract of the
dissertation. The dissertation may be accompanied by publications describing
the same research as the dissertation. However, the dissertation itself
also needs to be submitted.

SPEC Kaivalya Dixit Distinguished Dissertation Award is open to dissertations
defended between October 2021 and September 2023; a thesis can be nominated
only once, which means that a 2022 thesis nominated in 2023 cannot be
nominated again in 2024. If there are several outstanding submissions,
the committee may choose to split the award.

Nominations should be uploaded to EasyChair at URL:
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=specaward2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=specaward2023.</a> The submission system
is open with a hard nomination deadline of October 20st, AOE.

Nominations can be provided by anyone except the thesis author. Typically, it
is the thesis advisor or a member of the thesis defense committee, but other
people - especially experts in performance evaluation - can do so as well.

SCOPE AND TOPICS
----------------

The ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering
(ICPE) is the leading international forum for presenting and
discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends, and experiences in the
field of performance engineering.

Performance, energy efficiency, and reliability are becoming central
to the acceptance and sustainability of modern computing systems.
Digitalization brings computing technology closer to people and
manages most aspects of their life. In turn, human interaction
increasingly shapes the behavior of computing systems. As a result,
our systems become more complex and, therefore, more difficult to
engineer and understand. We need to be able to manage this complexity
so that our systems remain reliable, trustable, and performant.

ICPE brings together researchers and practitioners to report on open
problems, state-of-the-art solutions, and in-progress research in
performance engineering of software and systems - targeting
performance and associated quality attributes such as efficiency and
reliability in all phases of the computing system lifecycle, from
specification and development to run time and maintenance.

ICPE deals with performance and associated quality attributes across
all application domains. We encourage contributions that help extend
the state-of-the-art in particular, but not exclusively, in the
following areas:

- Measurement and Empirical Evaluation
- Modeling
- Design and Development Processes
- Performance Testing
- Managing Systems at Runtime
- Platform-Related Optimizations
- Benchmarking

ICPE caters to a wide range of submission types with eight distinct
submission tracks:

- Research track for regular research papers on the conference topics
- Industry track for contributions connecting to the industry
- Journal-first track for contributions from recent journal publications (new)
- Artifact track for sharing software and data artifacts
- Emerging research track for discussing preliminary or vision contributions
- Poster and demo track for short interactive contributions
- Tutorials track for presentations by leading scientists and practitioners
- Workshops track for specific aspects of performance engineering
- Data challenge track for addressing the challenges presented
  by a performance dataset

The conference proceedings are published in ACM Digital Library.
