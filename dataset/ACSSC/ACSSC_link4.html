          <p>The energy system is currently responsible for the majority of U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants, greenhouse gases, and short-lived climate forcing pollutants. Understanding how the energy system may evolve in the future and the resulting implications on the environment is critical if environmental decision-makers are to address these challenges proactively and efficiently. The goal of this session is to highlight research efforts involved in exploring the linkages among air quality, climate and energy, with a focus on supporting decision-making at federal, state or local levels. Among the topics that are appropriate for inclusion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scenario approaches for examining energy system futures, including exploring linkages between population growth, economic growth, land use change, climate change, technology change (in including cleantech), policy and energy</li>
<li>Impact of the future energy system on sustainability and vulnerability metrics</li>
<li>Translating energy system modeling into climate and air quality impacts</li>
<li>Identifying interactions between strategies for climate mitigation and air quality management, including quantification of co-benefits and holistic management strategies that simultaneously meet both goals</li>
<li>Models, tools and methodologies for assessing air, climate and energy linkages</li>

          <p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/cracmm">Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM)</a> is a chemical mechanism that was released for the first time in 2022 as part of CMAQv5.4 and is expected to become default in CMAQ in 2026. CRACMM aims to incorporate and leverage knowledge from the broad atmospheric science community to improve predictions of oxidants, hazardous air pollutants, and particulate matter. As a result, we seek developments from the atmospheric science community and feedback on future directions. This session will include an overview presentation highlighting CRACMM milestones completed, goals for the near future, resources available to leverage this chemistry, and a vision for community-oriented development. CMAS Conference attendees are invited to sign up for a 3 minute (up to 3 slides) presentation(s) on one or both of the following topics:</p>
<ul><li>What scientific advancements are mature and could be operationalized in a future version of CRACMM? For this topic, we ask developers to alert us to updates that could be of broad benefit to the CMAQ-CRACMM user and scientific communities. As follow-up, the CRACMM team will provide feedback on a path forward to incorporation in CRACMM.</li><li>What scientific questions should CRACMM be well suited to address in the next 5-10 years? For this topic, we ask community members to identify questions CRACMM is ready to address and/or questions that will need additional development to address. This information will inform development priorities and opportunities for collaboration.</li></ul>
<p>To contribute a 3 minute presentation, please provide a tentative title and a few sentences about the topic through the CMAS Conference abstract submission system (a full abstract is not required). The session will also include an open Q&amp;A period for general questions and comments.</p>

          <p>Typically, a limited number of specific simulations using chemical transport models (CTMs) or Gaussian plume models are used to derive relationships between emissions from particular sources and a response variable (pollutant concentration, health impact, etc.) for specific locations. We want to discuss here the potential usages/applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Reduced form models (RFM) that are computationally efficient and allow users to rapidly assess air quality impacts for a large number of emission scenarios, making them especially useful as screening tools for evaluating policy scenarios.<br><br>
There have been many ML and RFM implementations on air quality forecasting in recent years and this session focuses on the development, evaluation, and application of ML and RFMs. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing and evaluating ML and RFMs</li>
<li>Inter-comparison of ML and RFMs</li>
<li>Global or regional application of ML and RFMs on air quality, human health, ecosystem or other impacts</li>

          <p>Work in recent years has vastly improved the science of air quality and methodologies for modeling and analyzing the distribution of air pollutants at various temporal and spatial scales. Such advances were motivated by the results from the multitude of applications and evaluations of air quality models that addressed various research, development and regulatory modeling issues. We seek abstracts that illustrate innovative methodologies and process algorithms in air quality modeling. Session topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjoint models</li>
<li>Urban-scale and fine scale modeling and applications</li>
<li>New mechanisms of chemical reactions and processes for air quality modeling</li>
<li>Production and decay of hazardous air pollutants (HCHO, acetaldehyde, acrolein, nitroPAHs)</li>

          <p>The purpose of this session is to present modeling approaches for various applications ranging from exposure assessments in support of health studies to near-source assessments such as near-roadway studies or community-scale applications. A variety of models can provide these detailed, spatially-, and temporally-resolved concentrations in support of environmental health studies. Models also provide an opportunity to examine how changes in emissions affect near-road air quality or other near-to-source impacts. Local governments and community groups may be interested in what if scenarios such as how to optimize traffic patterns around heavily polluted areas. For example, when schools are located near roadways, models can help to examine potential impacts on children's health or the relative contribution of school-related exposure compared to, or combined with, home-related exposure. The topics for this session will involve development, evaluation and application of models with the following focal areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air quality modeling for exposure assessments in support of environmental health studies</li>
<li>Dispersion model development for applications with near-source complexities</li>
<li>Evaluation and inter-comparison of models for near roadway applications</li>
<li>Decision support tools to quantify risk of human exposure</li>
<li>Air quality applications focused on inequitable pollution exposures in different communities</li>

          Both observations and modeling studies have demonstrated the long-range inter-continental transport of pollutants. Changes in emission patterns over different regions of the world are likely to exacerbate the impacts of long-range pollutant transport on background pollutant levels in another region, which may then impact the attainment of local air quality standards. Additionally, increased concerns of climate impacts on regional and local ecosystem disciplines have driven the need to utilize outputs from global models into regional modeling systems with different temporal and spatial scales. In such applications, downscaling approaches have been used to link the two modeling systems, with different physical and dynamical characteristics, to bridge the gap between global and local effects. This session seeks papers that discuss key issues related to the consistent coupling of atmospheric physical and chemical processes on local-to-global scales and related modeling applications. Topics of interest in this session include:
<ul>
<li>Hemispheric chemistry transport models</li>
<li>Multi-scale climate and air quality modeling applications</li>
<li>Earth System Modeling and Feedbacks</li>
<li>Dynamical and statistical downscaling</li>
<li>Model evaluation and inter-comparison</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, evaluation of air quality modeling systems (including meteorological and emissions models) is a key to verify the integrity of such modeling systems for various applications at various spatial and temporal resolutions. Abstracts are invited that present results of model evaluation studies, with emphasis on new techniques for model evaluation. Session topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnostic tools</li>
<li>Analyses and comparisons with data from measurement networks</li>
<li>Process evaluation, including dynamic evaluation</li>
<li>Sensitivity of air quality models to meteorological inputs</li>

          <p>Papers in this session are devoted to analyzing data from both conventional and remote-sensing observational platforms. In particular, presentations are invited on the integration of data collected from different platforms, and on the use of new satellite data products in air quality modeling. Session topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Satellite processing products and its use</li>
<li>Monitoring air pollution and meteorology</li>
<li>Field measurement studies</li>
<li>Laboratory smog chamber experiments</li>
<li>Aerosol detection and sampling</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, new sensor technologies, due to their characteristics (e.g., low cost, small size, high portability), are becoming increasingly important for individual exposure assessment, especially since this kind of instrument can provide measurements at high spatial and temporal resolution, which is a notable advantage when approaching assessment of exposure to environmental contaminants.<br><br>
This session will provide information about advancements on the developments and use of sensor technology for air quality and health studies.<br>
Topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Novel air sensor technologies for monitoring air quality and health conditions</li>
<li>Evaluation and validation of sensor performance</li>
<li>Application of sensor network on air quality, exposure and health studies</li>
