<p>We ask attendees that feel unwell, are diagnosed, or test positive to COVID-19 right before or during the event, not to travel to the event or, if already on-site, to stay at the hotel and not attend the event, to avoid exposing others. See below in the ACM disclosure for what to do if you attended and tested positive after.</p>

<p>Please check the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html">website</a> (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for the latest information and guidelines (for reference, Bellevue is in King County, Washington).</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="acm-covid-19-disclosure--liability-waiver">ACM COVID-19 DISCLOSURE &amp; LIABILITY WAIVER</h4>

ACM urges each Event attendee or volunteer to review the Event venue’s safety protocols, should they be available, in advance of deciding whether to attend the Event. ACM cannot guarantee that its participants, volunteers, partners, or any others in attendance will not become infected with COVID-19.</p>

  <h5 id="obligation-to-comply-with-covid-19-safety-measures">Obligation to Comply with COVID-19 Safety Measures</h5>
  <p>We ask and expect that all attendees and volunteers will follow any and all applicable recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization concerning the need to isolate, quarantine, or take other steps to prevent spreading COVID-19.</p>

  <h5 id="duty-to-self-monitor--report">Duty to Self-Monitor &amp; Report</h5>

This waiver includes, but is not limited to, death, bodily injury, illness, economic loss or out of pocket expenses, or loss or damage to property, which I, my heirs, assignees, next of kin and/or legally appointed representatives may hereinafter accrue on my behalf, which arise or may hereafter arise from my participation in the Event.</p>

  <h5 id="assumption-of-the-risk">Assumption of the Risk</h5>
  <p>I acknowledge and understand the following:</p>

  <p>Participation in this Event includes possible exposure to and illness from infectious diseases including but not limited to COVID-19. While particular rules and personal discipline may reduce this risk, the risk of serious illness and death does exist; and</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I hereby knowingly and freely assume all such risks related to illness and infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, even if arising from the negligence or fault of the Released Parties; and</li>
    <li>I hereby knowingly assume the responsibility of reviewing the Event venue’s safety protocols before deciding whether to attend the Event and acknowledge that the decision of whether to attend the Event is solely mine; and</li>
    <li>I hereby knowingly assume the risk of injury, harm and loss associated with the Event, including any injury, harm, and loss caused by the negligence, fault or conduct of any kind on the part of the Released Parties; and</li>
    <li>I hereby knowingly assume the risk of any COVID-19 related travel costs I may incur in connection with attendance at the Event, including, but not limited to, the costs associated with any mandatory quarantine regulations, cancelled travel, etc.</li>
  </ul>
