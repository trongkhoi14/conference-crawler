                            The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research 
                            contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. 
                            MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and 
                            build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel 
                            ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, 
                            and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, 
                            and applications. <br><br>

                            MobiCom 2024 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, 
                            taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems 
                            research. On one hand, the more novel the concept, the harder it can be 
                            to fully develop or evaluate all its aspects. On the other hand, the more 
                            practical and developed the system, the more simple and sometimes known 
                            techniques must be leveraged. The review process will take both cases 
                            into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, 
                            system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will 
                            also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to 
                            well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases 
                            to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that 
                            highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations 
                            of the work.<br><br>

                            MobiCom 2024 will not have separate categories of challenge, experience, 
                            and verification papers. However, we do encourage the submission of experience 
                            papers as full papers that provide detailed technical insight into real-world 
                            deployments of novel technologies and systems. MobiCom 2024 will also 
                            incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 and 
                            rebuttals as described below in more detail.<br><br><br>

                            <h1>Two Deadlines, Early Notification, Rebuttals, and One-shot Revision</h1><br>

                            MobiCom 2024 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision 
                            process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research 
                            community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous 
                            MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. 
                            Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early 
                            notification, including reviews. After the second round of reviews, the reviews will 
                            be released to the authors and who will have one week to submit a rebuttal.<br>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Rebuttals</h3>
                            MobiCom will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to the final 
                            consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their 
                            responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing 
                            questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted 
                            work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments, new data, or new figures, 
                            describe additional work completed since submission or promise additional work to follow.

                            <br><br>
                            The submission of a rebuttal is optional. Rebuttals will be limited to a maximum of 500 
                            words submitted in the online submission form. It is worth noting that available reviews 
                            will be released at the above-mentioned times. However, additional reviews might be solicited 
                            or submitted after the rebuttal period.


                            <br><br>
                            <h3>Final decisions will be one of the following</h3>
                            <br>
                            <ul class="default_margin">
                                <li><b>Accept</b>: Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and
                                    appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in
                                    this category will initially be <i>conditionally accepted</i>. The papers that go
                                    through a successful <b>anonymous</b> shepherding process will eventually be
                                    accepted.</li>
                                <li><b>Reject</b>: Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months
                                    have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly
                                    encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the
                                    paper to MobiCom.</li>
                                <li><b>One-Shot-Revision</b>: Papers, where a revision is required, will be given
                                    specific action points and can be resubmitted for the <b>next</b> deadline. For such
                                    papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major
                                    changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the
                                    paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the
                                    reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested
                                    action points may include running additional experiments that obtain
                                    specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this
                                    revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom
                                    and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the
                                    authors first withdraw it from consideration.</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <h3>Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers</h3>
                            <br>
                            The authors of accepted MobiCom 2024 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to 
                            the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee that will 
                            assess how well the submitted artifacts support the work described in the accepted papers. 
                            Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, 
                            but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully 
                            will receive badges printed on the papers themselves. Additional details on the Artifact 
                            Evaluation process can be found here.

                            <br>
                            All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the <a href="https://mobicom24.hotcrp.com/">MobiCom 2024 paper submission website</a>. Authors
                            should prepare a PDF version of their full paper. All submitted papers will be evaluated
                            through a <b>double-blind</b> reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld
                            from the reviewers.
                            <br><br>
                            Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the
                            following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including
                            additional material: <b>​submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be
                                reviewed​.</b> You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using
                            the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​<a href="https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/~voelker/banal/">online form</a>. After the
                            submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The
                            format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually
                            inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper
                            will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked.
                            <br><br>
                            Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

                             process for your accepted paper.  ACM has been involved in ORCID
                             from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect
                              <a href="https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs">ORCID IDs from all of our published authors</a>.  The

                            <br>
                            In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are ​expected to make sure that
                            their paper complies with the following submission policies.
                            <br><br>
                            <h2>Previous Publications</h2>
                             We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster,
                              demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such
                              case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop
                              publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., "[7] Anonymized workshop
                              paper") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission
                              and the prior workshop paper (e.g. "This paper extends a prior workshop
                              paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."). In addition, the
                              online submission form will require authors to submit the deanonymized
                              citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior
                              workshop paper. The PC will review such extended versions of
                              previously-published workshop papers in accordance with the ACM
                              Plagiarism Policy.

                            <h2>No Simultaneous Submissions</h2>

                            All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for
                            another conference or journal. It is ACM policy (<a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy" target="_blank">​ACM
                                Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous

                            concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be
                            <b>immediately rejected</b> from all conferences/journals involved. <br><br>

                            The ACM policy on simultaneous submissions does not consider technical
                            reports (including arXiv) to be concurrent publications or submissions.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In prior work[3], we presented a routing protocol
                                    that …”<br>
                                    Instead, refer to your work in the third person, such as<br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“In prior work, Smith[3] presented a routing protocol
                                    that …”<br>
                                    With this method, the full citation to Smith can still be given, such as<br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3] Smith, J., "Analysis of … "<br>
                                    In particular, it is not acceptable to say <br>

                                <li>Please avoid advertising the paper with the same or similar title on your webpage,
                                    social media, or through large mailing lists. Authors may include links to websites
                                    that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. The link in the
                                    paper, however, must be anonymized. Reviewers are not obliged to
                                  review such supplementary materials and such links must not be used to
                                  provide additional text that does not fit within the 12-page limit of
                                  the paper.</li>
                                <li>Authors are allowed to give talks to restricted audiences on the work(s) submitted
                                    to MobiCom during the review. If you have posted or plan to post a non-anonymized
                                    version of your paper on a preprint server before the MobiCom decisions are made,
                                    the submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version. MobiCom strongly
                                    discourages advertising the preprint on social media, personal web pages or in the
                                    press while under submission to MobiCom. Finally, any reviewer aware of the
                                    authorship of a specific submission, may not be allowed to review the paper, at the
                                    discretion of the PC chairs.

                            <h2><a name="COI"></a>Conflict of Interest (CoI)</h2>
                            For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the
                            submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the
                            submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission
                            website.<br><br>

                            We generally follow the ACM policy (<a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest" target="_blank">Conflict of Interest Policy for ACM Publications</a>) and also add and
                            extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define COIs of one submission at
                            MobiCom ’23 as:<br>

                            (1) any PC member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author
                            in <b>the last 24 months</b> or reasonably expected within <b>the next 12 months</b>;<br>
                            (2) any PC member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with
                            collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;<br>
                            (3) any PC member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or
                            others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12
                            months;<br>
                            (4) any PC member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author;<br>
                            (5) any PC member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same
                            advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;<br>
                            (6) any PC member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being
                            submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview
                            talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);<br>
                            (7) any PC member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond
                            professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;<br>
                            (8) others perceivable conflicts.<br><br>

                            A potential COI must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during
                            the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before
                            acceptance decisions are made.<br><br>
                            The author(s) must identify every COI out of all PC members (including chairs) with
                            <b>any</b> author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission
                            process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs
                            and explain the perceived conflict.<br><br>
                            Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated COI, and knowingly and falsely asserting a COI —
                            e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek
                            disadvantage of another — are both considered as a violation of this COI policy. We will
                            return the violated submissions with no reviews.<br><br>

                            <b>Anonymous and Rigorous Shepherding</b><br>
                            Conditionally accepted papers will be shepherded through a review process by a TPC member.
                            Based on the feedback written in the reviews, authors of shepherded papers will submit a
                            revision of their paper to the shepherd. The shepherd will collaborate with the reviewers
                            from TPC to review the revised paper and provide the authors with additional comments. Note
                            that the shepherding process could last 4-6 weeks and the authors might be asked to produce
                            new experimental results and/or add new material. When the shepherding process results in
                            final acceptance, the authors will upload their camera-ready file to the submissions
                            system.<br><br>

                            <b>Video Presentation</b><br>
                            The authors of each accepted paper will be asked to submit a one-minute video to introduce
                            the research presented in their paper to the general public. These videos will be placed on
                            the conference website and conference YouTube channel up to two weeks before the conference.
                            A selected set will be featured by the social media channels related to the
                            conference.<br><br>

                            <b>Registration and Presentation</b><br>
                            By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will register and attend
                            the conference to present it.<br><br><br>
