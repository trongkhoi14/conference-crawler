----------------------------------------

The APSEC 2023 workshops will provide a forum to discuss current topics in software engineering
research and practice, offering opportunities for researchers and practitioners to exchange
and discuss innovative scientific and engineering ideas before they have matured to warrant
conference or journal publication, as well as new developments in the field.

This year, APSEC 2023 is hosting six workshops covering various topics in software engineering:

CIW 2023: 1st Workshop on Code Intelligence
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/code-intelligence-workshop/">https://sites.google.com/view/code-intelligence-workshop/</a>
================================

* Call for papers:
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/code-intelligence-workshop/#h.w02g63yblauq">https://sites.google.com/view/code-intelligence-workshop/#h.w02g63yblauq</a>

* Description:

This workshop program will explore the world of code intelligence, with a particular emphasis
on its uses in the contexts of software implementation and verification. The scope of the
workshop includes a variety of topics, such as code generation, code completion, code analysis,
debugging, testing, document generation, and development environments, as well as security,
dependability, and real-time functionality considerations. The program will also cover a
wide range of subjects that span the whole software development lifecycle, ranging from the
requirements phase to continuous maintenance.

EEE-OSS 2023: Exploring Employee Experience in Open Source Software
<a href="https://eee-oss.github.io">https://eee-oss.github.io</a>
================================

* Call for papers: <a href="https://eee-oss.github.io/submission/">https://eee-oss.github.io/submission/</a>

* Organizing committee: <a href="https://eee-oss.github.io/organization/">https://eee-oss.github.io/organization/</a>

* Description:

This is the first international workshop on Exploring Employee Experience in Open Source
Software. In recent years, the employee experience, such as well-being, has become increasingly
important for software developers.  Enhancing the employee experience can lead to greater
developer satisfaction, which in turn benefits the organization at large.

Open-source software (OSS) development is mainly sustained by volunteers.  This structure implies
that developers in the open-source software community may enjoy a positive employee experience.

Given this background, our workshop invites papers that mainly investigate employee/developer
experience within OSS. Below is a list of the main topics the workshop will cover.

- Empirically exploration and mining software repositories
- Experience report
- Engagement analysis
- Empowerment approach
- Others related to OSS

To attend this workshop, all participants must register for the APSEC2023 Full Pass, which
covers both the conference and the workshop. The workshop will be held on Dec. 4.

ISE 2023: 2nd International Workshop on Intelligent Software Engineering
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ise2023">https://sites.google.com/view/ise2023</a>
================================

* Call for papers: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ise2023/call-for-papers">https://sites.google.com/view/ise2023/call-for-papers</a>

* Description:

ISE 2023 aims to present new ideas and theories to explore, evaluate and solve software
engineering problems with intelligent approaches. Nowadays, many researchers have proposed
and developed various AI-based methods and tools to improve developers' productivity and the
quality of software products. The methods can be involved in all stages of software development
and evolution, such as requirements analysis, software architecture, design, implementation,
testing, and maintenance. For example, researchers have applied deep learning techniques to
the areas of automatic code generation, automatic classification of requirements, and various
recommendation systems for software engineering.

However, some researchers only focus on the application and improvement of AI technologies. The
research results are far from the viewpoint of software engineering, not solving problems or
satisfying requirements.  Rather than applying new AI technologies to specific SE problems,
this workshop focuses on software engineering problems, new ideas and theories to mitigate
and solve the problems, and discussions on such problems and solutions.

This workshop brings together various researchers, tool developers, practitioners, and students
to develop methodologies and tools for intelligent or automated software engineering. The
participants in the workshop will discuss various ideas and expected effects of intelligent
software engineering. In addition, the participants can present and discuss their experiences
and difficulties in specific domains, such as autonomous driving and medical artificial
intelligence. By discussing ideas, problems, and expected effects, all the participants can
explore and set up the directions of intelligent software engineering for upcoming years.

IWESQ 2023: 5th International Workshop on Experience with SQuaRE series and its future direction
<a href="http://selab.ise.shibaura-it.ac.jp/iwesq.html">http://selab.ise.shibaura-it.ac.jp/iwesq.html</a>

* Call for papers: <a href="http://selab.ise.shibaura-it.ac.jp/iwesq2023.pdf">http://selab.ise.shibaura-it.ac.jp/iwesq2023.pdf</a>

* Description:

The ISO/IEC 25000 (Systems and Software Quality Requirements and Evaluation: SQuaRE) series
are a set of international standards for systems and software, data and IT service quality,
which have been widely used for a couple of decades. In the research field, they have been
also examined as a tool for performing various analyses and evaluations on systems and
software quality.

This workshop aims at sharing such research outcomes and issues, and experience of practical
applications of the SQuaRE series, in order to promote much more fruitful research and practice
for quality systems and software products.

QuASoQ 2023: 11th International Workshop on Quantitative Approaches to Software Quality
<a href="https://quasoq2023.swc-rwth.de/">https://quasoq2023.swc-rwth.de/</a>
================================

* Call for papers: <a href="https://quasoq2023.swc-rwth.de/callForPapers.php">https://quasoq2023.swc-rwth.de/callForPapers.php</a>

* Description:

The workshop aims to gather together researchers and practitioners to discuss experiences in
applying state-of-the-art approaches to measure, assess, and evaluate the quality of both
software systems and software development processes in general and software test processes
in particular.

Software development organizations are always forced to develop software of the "right"
quality. Hence, quality specification and quality assurance are crucial. Although there are
many approaches to dealing with quantitative quality aspects, it is still challenging to choose
a suitable set of techniques that best fit the specific project and organizational constraints.

Even though approaches, methods, and techniques have been known for quite some time now, little
effort has been spent on the exchange of real-world problems with quantitative approaches. For
example, only limited research has been devoted to empirically evaluating the risks, efficiency,
or limitations of different testing techniques in industrial settings.

Hence, one main goal of the workshop is to exchange experience, present new promising approaches,
and discuss how to set up, organize, and maintain quantitative approaches to software quality.
