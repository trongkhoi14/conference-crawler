The EurAI Fellows program was initiated in 1999 to recognize individuals who have made significant, sustained contributions to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. The EurAI Fellows Program honors only a very small percentage of the total membership of all EurAI member societies (up to a maximum of 3%). Each Fellow will receive a Certificate signed by the EurAI Chair. At each ECAI conference, a Fellows lunch will be sponsored by EurAI to honor the recently elected Fellows. The names of the recently elected Fellows are published each year on the EurAI web page.   \n\n## Who is eligible to be a EurAI Fellow?  \n\nCandidates must be current members of a EurAI member organisation to be eligible for consideration. Usually, only individuals who have contributed to AI for a decade or more after receiving their PhD (or are at an equivalent career stage) will be selected.  \n\n## Who can make a Nomination?  \n\nThere are two ways that an individual can be nominated:  \n- A EurAI member society can make a nomination. Please note that for each member society, the number of nominations is limited to a maximum of three.\n- A nomination can be made by two EurAI Fellows, who must be from different countries.\n\n## What is the Nomination process?  \n\nA nomination must be a single PDF document, including the following:  \n- a statement confirming which EurAI member society the candidate is currently a member of;   \n- a comprehensive current CV of the candidate; \n- three separate letters of reference, each of which should clearly make a case for why the individual is considered appropriate for EurAI fellowship.\n\nThe nomination document should be submitted via EasyChair at\n \n*[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=euraifellows2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=euraifellows2024).*\n\n(if the system asks for an abstract - it can be omitted). Please include the name of the nominee in the title of the submission.\n\nNominations must be submitted by April 30, 2024. We will announce the EurAI Fellows by the end of June.\n\n## How will Nominations be evaluated?  \n\nThe EurAI fellows committee will evaluate all nominations. \nThe key evaluation criterion will be whether the nominee has achieved exceptional distinction in AI in Europe. The distinction may be evidenced in several ways -- fellows' accomplishments range from pioneering advances in the theory of AI to unusual achievements in AI technology and applications. Leadership in EurAI or EurAI member societies, support of forums for the exchange of ideas, and exceptional service for the international AI community will also be considered in the selection process.  \n\nMost fellowship nominations are for technical contributions, and for most of these, the case is usually based on the nominee's scientific achievements as documented in their publication record. In evaluating such a publication record, the fellowship committee will look for clear evidence of scientific excellence, which may, for example, come in the form of a citation record that indicates a profound influence on the field, a publication record of exceptional quality, or technical results of unusual depth, insight, and impact. Publications in top general AI conferences and AI journals such as ECAI, AAAI, IJCAI, JAIR, and AIJ are important. Note that other forms of technical contribution evidence will also be considered, such as patent awards or statements of longstanding contribution to an industrial AI group effort that has been influential in the field generally; again, clear evidence should be provided of such influence. The fellowship committee will, in all cases, ultimately make decisions based on their professional judgment of the overall quality of the case.  \n\nIf you would like to see all the Distinguished Fellows since 1999, [**click here**](https://eurai.org/award/fellows) \n\n","published_at":"2021-12-16T15:33:52.000Z","created_at":"2021-12-16T16:33:27.000Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T13:39:24.000Z","Tag":null,"PublishedDate":null,"slug":"applications/fellows-program","Image":[{"id":47,"name":"Grupo 574.svg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":162,"height":162,"formats":null,"hash":"Grupo_574_c9fa7673a5","ext":".svg","mime":"image/svg+xml","size":147.62,"url":"/uploads/Grupo_574_c9fa7673a5.svg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T16:36:55.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T16:36:55.000Z"}],"LargeImage":null},{"id":4,"Title":"How to apply to the Dissertation awards","Description":"Nominations are invited for the 2023 Artificial Intelligence Dissertation Award sponsored by EurAI, the European Association of Artificial Intelligence.

All information, including guidelines for eligibility and duties of sponsored conferences, regarding requesting sponsorship can be found on this page. Calls are sent out to all EurAI member organisations twice a year (March and October), with a submission deadline twice per year (April and November).\n\n- Conference organizers who want to apply for funding for a conference that takes place before the end of December 2024 should apply before April 15, 2024. Fill this [form](https://forms.gle/sE9RtppUfh3Tfrr59) to apply.\n- Conference organizers who want to apply for funding for a conference that takes place before the end of June 2025 should apply before November 30, 2024. \n\n##\n##\n \n1. Which conferences are eligible for sponsorship?\n\nAny international conference is eligible, provided that it is either a general AI conference or a specialized conference whose main topic is clearly recognized as an AI topic. Those include, for instance (but the list is not exhaustive): planning, constraint satisfaction, knowledge representation and reasoning, multi-agent systems, uncertainty in AI, machine learning, natural language processing, robotics and vision, diagnosis, and others.\n\nNational or otherwise local conferences within Europe (e.g., German AI conference, Italian AI Conference, Benelux AI Conference, Scandinavian AI conference etc.) are not eligible.\n\nNational or regional conferences outside Europe (i.e., PRICAI, Australian AI Conference, Latin-American Conference etc.) are not eligible.\n\nNote that AAAI is eligible (it is no longer a North American AI Conference).\n\n2. What is sponsorship for, and how much?\n\nSponsorship is usually given for an invited talk. The invitee should belong to a European AI society member of EurAI. Depending on the costs, EurAI can pay for the travel and local costs of the speaker, or for only a part of them. The maximum amount is 1,000€, but there can be exceptions if the request is well-argumented.\n\n3. What are the duties and rights of the sponsored conference?\n\nThe conference must properly acknowledge that the invited talk is a EurAI talk. This must be acknowledged in the program on the website on the printed program and must be announced orally before the talk is given. EurAI sponsorship entitles you to use EurAI's name and logo when advertising the event. EurAI's name and logo have to be linked to https://eurai.org/ on the official conference website.\n\n4. Can a conference apply several times?\n\nYes, provided that it fulfilled the duties in the past. However, if several conferences apply and EurAI cannot sponsor them all, priority will be given to those that have never been sponsored or not been sponsored recently by EurAI.\n\n##\n##\nIf you have any questions regarding the above, please contact [Manolis Koubarakis](https://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~koubarak/), member of the EurAI Board.  \nTo see all the sponsored conferences [click here](https://eurai.org/sponsored-activities)\n","published_at":"2021-12-16T15:34:15.000Z","created_at":"2021-12-16T16:34:08.000Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T14:57:42.000Z","Tag":null,"PublishedDate":null,"slug":"applications/sponsored-conferences","Image":[{"id":49,"name":"Grupo 586.svg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":127,"height":155,"formats":null,"hash":"Grupo_586_f23001708b","ext":".svg","mime":"image/svg+xml","size":74.56,"url":"/uploads/Grupo_586_f23001708b.svg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T16:37:32.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T16:37:32.000Z"}],"LargeImage":null},{"id":6,"Title":"How to apply to Sponsored Education Programs","Description":"Please send your application for EurAI scientific sponsorship of your AI education program to the EuarAI chair.","published_at":"2021-12-16T15:34:39.000Z","created_at":"2021-12-16T16:34:36.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-31T08:26:21.000Z","Tag":null,"PublishedDate":null,"slug":"applications/sponsored-educations","Image":[{"id":50,"name":"Grupo 587.svg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":112,"height":144,"formats":null,"hash":"Grupo_587_dc4842d5f8","ext":".svg","mime":"image/svg+xml","size":110.57,"url":"/uploads/Grupo_587_dc4842d5f8.svg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-12-16T16:37:58.000Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T09:43:40.000Z"}],"LargeImage":{"id":85,"name":"book.png","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":601,"height":403,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_book.png","hash":"thumbnail_book_b9ff5d5c78","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":233,"height":156,"size":13.73,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_book_b9ff5d5c78.png"},"small":{"name":"small_book.png","hash":"small_book_b9ff5d5c78","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","width":500,"height":335,"size":54.7,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_book_b9ff5d5c78.png"}},"hash":"book_b9ff5d5c78","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","size":35.38,"url":"/uploads/book_b9ff5d5c78.png","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-12-30T10:41:41.000Z","updated_at":"2021-12-30T10:41:41.000Z"}},{"id":8,"Title":"How to apply for ECAI Travel Grants","Description":"## Information about Travel Grants for ECAI-2024\n\nThe purpose of the Travel Grant is to support applicants who have limited or no access to other funding for supporting their travel.

The structure of ESSAI has been deeply inspired by the ESSLLI (European Summer School on Logic, Language and Information), organised in 1989 by the Association for Logic, Language and Information (FoLLI). The ESSAI Summer School covers two weeks of courses and workshops in the summer, in different sites around Europe, for beginning and advanced students and junior and senior researchers. ESSAI provides foundational, introductory, and advanced courses in all areas of AI, emphasising topics that allow students to gain a broad view of AI and understand connections between subdisciplines. In addition, it hosts four evening lectures in which prominent researchers present interdisciplinary overviews of recent developments for a broad audience. ESSAI also offers several social activities for students and researchers alike. ESSAI summer schools aim to attract around 400/500 students from Europe and elsewhere. ESSAI wants to develop into an important meeting place and forum for discussion for students and researchers interested in the interdisciplinary study of Artificial Intelligence in a broad sense. One of the main attraction points is ESSAI’s unique scientific and social atmosphere.\n\nOne of the tracks of ESSAI consists of advanced tutorials on a specific subject and corresponds to the traditional ACAI school organised by EurAI since 1989.\n\nESSAI courses and the ESSAI program are selected by an ESSAI Program Committee, elected by the ESSAI Standing Committee, consisting of EurAI Board Members and chosen people from the previous editions of ESSAI.  The ACAI track program of ESSAI instead is decided by you as local organisers in consultation with the ESSAI PC for the final details.\n\nThe school can occur any time in the Summer of 2024 and 2025. It should aim at hosting 400/500 students, with a variety of courses (around six parallel tracks) for two weeks. Facilities for evening lectures are also important. ESSAI 2024 and ESSAI 2025 are planned as in-person events, but support for live-stream/recording of the lectures will be appreciated.  Local organisers should provide lunch and coffee breaks and organise social events. The aim is to keep registration, travel, and accommodation costs low. \n\nPlease provide a concise PDF document addressing the above points; in particular, please answer the following point regarding the event:\n\n Names of the organisers\n EurAI member society supporting the application\n Possible dates for the summer school\n How do you plan to advertise the summer school\n Tentative registration fees, an estimate of costs, and break-even of the event\n Explain why you/your group are a good host for the summer school\n State whether your host institution will support the school, e.g., by providing free/cheap   lecture rooms\n Explain the benefits of the location (costs, reachability, attractiveness for students, social events\n\nPlease also give details of the ACAI tutorial track organisation:\n\nDescription of the ACAI topic\nStructure of ACAI tutorial track program \nNumber of days (usually one week, but flexibility is allowed)\nLength of the tutorials (2, 3 or 4 hours, but flexibility is allowed)\nTentative list of lecturers\n\n\nFor your convenience, here are pointers to ESSAI 2023 (which, as the first school, was only one week and held together with ESSLLI) and recent ACAI schools:\n\nESSAI 2023, Slovenia, Ljubljana (joined with EU ICT48 TAILOR Summer School) \n\nACAI 2022, Barcelona, Spain, Explainable AI (joined with EU ICT48 TAILOR Summer School) \n\nACAI 2021, Berlin, Germany, Human-Centered AI \n\nACAI 2019, Chania, Crete, AI for Multi-Agent Worlds \n\nACAI 2018, Ferrara, Italy, Statistical Relational AI \n\n\n\nEurAI shall provide start-up money for 12.000€ or ESSAI 2024 and ESSAI 2025 to help cover the cost of organising ESSAI.  After the conference, this money will be returned to the EurAi account. The Organizing Committee is obligated to provide EurAI with a proposal for the registration fees for ESSAI (including planned registration fee waivers for lecturers, etc.) for approval by EurAI before posting this publicly. EurAI will provide travel grants worth between €250 and €750 each, up to a total of no more than €12000, to students participating in ESSAI, the EurAI eligibility rules, as published on the EurAI web pages.\n\n\nProposals should be sent as a single pdf file to Marija Trifuncevic at e-mail:  [executive-secretary@eurai.org](mailto:executive-secretary@eurai.org) \n\nAlso, for any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Marija Trifuncevic at the email above.\n\nThe deadline for submission is \u003c15/09/2023\u003e AoE.\n\n","published_at":"2023-06-13T07:18:19.000Z","created_at":"2023-06-13T07:17:52.000Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T09:54:48.000Z","Tag":null,"PublishedDate":"2023-06-12","slug":"applications/Call-for-bids-to-host-ESSAI-2024-2025","Image":[{"id":41,"name":"drawing.svg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":247,"height":231,"formats":null,"hash":"drawing_5a0c03917f","ext":".svg","mime":"image/svg+xml","size":92.42,"url":"/uploads/drawing_5a0c03917f.svg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-11-29T10:29:40.000Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T10:29:40.000Z"}],"LargeImage":null},{"id":16,"Title":"Call for Project Proposals  European History of Artificial Intelligence","Description":"\n\nThe European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI) is delighted to announce a call for\nproject proposals on the topic of the \"European History of Artificial Intelligence.” This call\ninvites proposals for projects in various formats, including but not limited to the creation of\nvideos, collection of interviews, development of books, and other innovative mediums.

He developed a novel toolkit for treewidth-based lower bounds for many problems in AI, where he solved a question that has been open for more than a decade. With the help of this toolkit, he proved that a significant improvement of a whole list of treewidth-based algorithms in AI is very unlikely.  \n\n\n**To see other EurAI Dissertation Awardees [click here](https://eurai.org/award/mikel-artexte)**","published_at":"2022-07-04T14:04:07.000Z","created_at":"2022-07-04T14:01:08.000Z","updated_at":"2024-05-27T17:28:36.000Z","AppearAsNews":true,"NewsPublicationDate":"2022-07-04","slug":"award/markus-hecher","Image":{"id":92,"name":"Markus_Full.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":2343,"height":2520,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Markus_Full.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Markus_Full_f2604105cf","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":145,"height":156,"size":4.01,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Markus_Full_f2604105cf.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_Markus_Full.jpg","hash":"large_Markus_Full_f2604105cf","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":930,"height":1000,"size":97.5,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Markus_Full_f2604105cf.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Markus_Full.jpg","hash":"medium_Markus_Full_f2604105cf","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":697,"height":750,"size":56.74,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Markus_Full_f2604105cf.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_Markus_Full.jpg","hash":"small_Markus_Full_f2604105cf","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":465,"height":500,"size":25.5,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Markus_Full_f2604105cf.jpg"}},"hash":"Markus_Full_f2604105cf","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":582.78,"url":"/uploads/Markus_Full_f2604105cf.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2022-07-04T14:15:01.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-04T14:15:01.000Z"}},{"id":31,"Name":"Luc Steels","Affiliation":"Institute for Evolutionary Biology (CSIC,UPF)","URL":"https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/steels/","AwardType":"DistinguishedServiceAward","Year":"2022","Description":"# Distinguished Service Award 2022  \n\n**Prof. Dr. Luc Steels is awarded the EurAI Distinguished Service Award 2022 for his pioneering and groundbreaking work in the field of Artificial Intelligence, as well as for his foundational contributions to the AI organization in the European Union.**  \n \nProf. Dr. Luc Steels is a Belgian researcher and artist.
