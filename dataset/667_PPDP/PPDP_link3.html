OVERVIEW

The PPDP 2024 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms for concurrency, security, static analysis, and verification.

PPDP 24&nbsp; will be held at Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy and, as part of FM 2024. At least one of the authors of an accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the paper.
Information about venue and travel will be available on the FM 2024 website.

Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from principles to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency, parallelism and distribution; modules; functional languages; reactive languages; languages with objects; languages for quantum computing; languages inspired by biological and chemical computation; metaprogramming.

- Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming; database languages; knowledge representation languages; probabilistic languages; differentiable languages.

- Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management.

- Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics.

- Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation; control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation; debugging; testing.

- Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application; education.

PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions can be made in three categories:

- Regular Research Papers,
- System Descriptions, and
- Experience Reports.

Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography).
Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC chair in case of questions). Research papers will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, clarity, and readability.

Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality, significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published, refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional, logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must not exceed 5 pages **including references**.
Experience Reports must be marked as such at the time of submission and need not report original research results. They will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability.

Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to:

- insights gained from real-world projects using declarative programming

- comparison of declarative programming with conventional programming in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum

- curricular issues encountered when using declarative programming in education

- real-world constraints that created special challenges for an implementation of a declarative language or for declarative programming in general

- novel use of declarative programming in the classroom

- programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or programming technique.

Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended version of the submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix beyond the above-mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study extended versions or any material beyond the respective page limit. Material beyond the page limit will not be included in the final published version.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of the "Current ACM Master Template" which is available at (https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings template as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in other formats.

Authors should note ACM's statement on author's rights (http://authors.acm.org/) which apply to final papers.
Submitted papers should meet the requirements of ACM's plagiarism policy] http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy).

The reviewing is single-blind, with a two-days rebuttal phase.
