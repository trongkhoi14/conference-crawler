    "CallForPaper": "IMPORTANT DATES\n\nPaper submission deadline: January 12, 2024  Extended to January 31, 2024 Extended to February 16, 2024 (Firm)\n\nAcceptance notification: March 31, 2024 \n\nCamera-ready paper: April 26, 2024; (Extended) May 20, 2024\n\nSCOPE\n\nIEEE NetSoft, the premier International Conference on Network Softwarization, addresses the advanced research challenges and opportunities raised by the overall transformation trend of network “softwarization”, which has been revolutionizing the networking field and has accelerated its convergence with adjacent industries.\n\nNetwork Softwarization refers to the transition of traditional network infrastructure and functionalities, provided via hardware appliances developed by equipment and service vendors, to new ones that have been propelled over the last 15 years by the maturity of widespread technologies such as network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and service function chaining. In particular, the ability to program, manage, and operate network and service infrastructures more freely makes it possible to reinvent network and cloud architectures, customize services, accelerate service deployment, and facilitate greater operational efficiencies with guarantees. The need for further advances in these topics is reflected in the overall theme of NetSoft 2024: “Softwarized Networks in the Age of Generative AI”. \n\nNetSoft 2024 will feature technical paper presentations, keynotes, tutorials, workshops, demos, posters,  and exhibitions from world-leading experts representing service providers, vendors, research institutes, open-source projects, and academia. \n\n \n\nTOPICS OF INTEREST\n\nThe conference is soliciting paper submissions with significant research contributions to network softwarization. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nNetwork slicing and slice management  \n\nService Function Chaining (SFC)\n\nAI/ML techniques and network softwarization   \n\nApplications for Generative AI in softwarized networks\n\nSoftwarization in eXtended Reality  (AR/VR/ER and digital twins)   \n\nCooperative multi-domain, multi-tenant SDN/NFV environments \n\nFuture Internet and New IP architectures  \n\nSustainability in softwarized network\n\nHigh-precision communications and computing     \n\nNetwork softwarization for 5G/6G   \n\nQoS and QoE in softwarized infrastructures\n\nNetwork softwarization for deterministic Internet re-engineering   \n\nSoftwarization for Cognitive and autonomic networking   \n\nPolicy-based and Intent-based networking\n\nDynamic resource discovery and negotiation schemes \n\nAssurance and Measurements in softwarized networks \n\nResilience, reliability, and robustness of softwarized networks  \n\nSecurity, Safety, Trust, and Privacy in virtualized environments\n\nSustainability, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions in network softwarization   \n\nAbstractions and virtualization of resources, services, and functions\n\nProgrammable Networking Protocols   \n\nProgrammable SDN and NFV: languages and architectures (P4 and others)  \n\nOpen source and network softwarization\n\nHardware acceleration for programmable network functions  \n\nDevelopment methodologies for network softwarization (DevOps, NetOps, Verification)  \n\nDeployment and transition strategies\n\nExperience reports from experimental testbeds and deployments\n\nNew value chains and service models enabled by softwarization\n\nSocio-economic impact and regulations for softwarization\n\n \n\nPAPER SUBMISSION\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit high-quality original technical papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the NetSoft 2024 Proceedings. All submissions must be written in English and must use the standard IEEE two-column conference template that can be downloaded from https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html.\n\nTechnical Papers can be of two types: Full or Short papers, up to 9 and 5 pages, respectively, including references and all other material. If accepted, a paper will be published in the category (long/short) of its submission. Long papers are the more traditional form for presenting technical work. Long papers should emphasize not only novelty and vision, but execution and thoroughness of the contribution (design, evaluation). Short papers are the preferred vehicle for visionary papers or traditional technical papers whose description fits within a smaller number of pages.

    "CallForPaper": "SCOPE\n\nThe purpose of the International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is to bring together researchers, engineers, faculty, and practitioners interested in both theoretical advances and practical applications in the field of operations research. Two simultaneous tracks will be held, covering on one side domain independent methodologies and technologies and on the other side practical work developed in specific application areas.\n\nICORES focuses on real world challenges; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Operations Research Methodologies and Technologies for industry and services, either in general or for particular applications. Ideas on how to solve specific business problems as well as larger enterprise challenges, using operations research methodologies and technologies, will arise from the conference. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, case studies, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICORES. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both formal oral presentations and informal poster sessions.\n\nSpecial sessions focused on case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials for technical/scientific topics and practical applications are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in offering a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat.\n\nCONFERENCE AREAS\n\nEach of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:\n\n1. METHODOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES\n2. APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n\nAREA 1: METHODOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES\n\n\nBusiness Analytics/Management Sciences\nData Sciences\nDecision Analysis\nDesign, Analysis, and Innovation for Enterprise Systems\nDynamic Programming\nForecasting\nGame Theory\nIndustrial Engineering\nInformation Systems\nLinear Programming\nNetwork Optimization\nOptimization\nPredictive Analytics\nQueuing Theory\nSimulation\nStochastic Optimization\nStochastic Processes\nAREA 2: APPLICATIONS\n\n\nAI/ML Applications in OR\nDecision Support Systems\nEnvironment and Sustainability\nOptimization in Finance\nOR in Education\nOR in Emergency Management\nOR in Energy\nOR in Health\nOR in Logistics, Maintenance, and Supply\nOR in National Defense/International Security\nOR in Telecommunications\nOR in Transportation\nProject Management\nResource Allocation\nRisk Management\nRobotics/Autonomous Systems\nRouting\nScheduling\nSupply Chain Management\nSystems of Systems/Teams and Socio-Technical Systems\nKEYNOTE SPEAKER\nSamuel Moniz, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Coimbra, Portugal\n\nPAPER SUBMISSION\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas.\n\nAuthors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity.\n\nWhen submitting a complete paper please note that only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to read INSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism thoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.\n\nAll papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail.\n\n\n\n \nPUBLICATIONS\n\nAll accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support.\nSCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (http://www.crossref.org/) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).\nThe proceedings will be submitted for indexation by SCOPUS, Google Scholar, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, EI and Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nConference Date: 23 - 25 February, 2025\n\n\nRegular Papers\nPaper Submission: October 2, 2024\nAuthors Notification: December 4, 2024\nCamera Ready and Registration: December 20, 2024\n\n\n\nPosition Papers\nPaper Submission: November 13, 2024\nAuthors Notification: December 20, 2024\nCamera Ready and Registration: January 13, 2025\n\n\nWorkshops\nWorkshop Proposal: October 17, 2024\n\n\nDoctoral Consortium\nPaper Submission: December 18, 2024\nAuthors Notification: January 14, 2025\nCamera Ready and Registration: January 22, 2025\n\n\nSpecial Sessions\nSpecial Session Proposal: October 17, 2024\n\n\nTutorials\nTutorial Proposal: January 17, 2025\n\n\nDemos\nDemo Proposal: January 17, 2025\n\n\nPanels\nPanel Proposal: January 17, 2025\n\n\nAbstracts\nAbstract Submission: January 7, 2025\nAuthors Notification: January 20, 2025\nCamera Ready and Registration: January 28, 2025\n\n\nSECRETARIAT\n\nICORES Secretariat\nAddress: Avenida de S.

    "CallForPaper": "Important Dates (all times are 23:59 Anywhere On Earth, UTC-12)\n\nAbstract submission deadline: January 10, 2024\nAuthor information deadline: January 16, 2024\nFull paper submission deadline: January 17, 2024\nAppendix and resubmission information deadline: January 24, 2024\nSummary reject notification: February 22, 2024\nAuthor response period: March 18-21, 2024\nPaper notification: April 16, 2024\nConference: Saturday, August 3rd to Friday, August 9th, 2024. \n\nSubmissions are invited for the 33rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, which is planned to be held in Jeju Island, South Korea, from August 3rd to August 9th, 2024.  Since 1969, IJCAI has remained the premier conference bringing together the international AI community to communicate the advances and achievements of artificial intelligence research.\n\nIn addition to the main track, the authors will be able to submit papers to the three special tracks (AI for Good , AI the   Arts and Creativity, and Human-Centred AI), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below.\n\nSubmissions to IJCAI 2024 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.\n\nA selection of the best papers submitted to IJCAI 2024 will be invited for a fast track in the Artificial Intelligence Journal and/or the Journal of AI Research.\n\nContact for questions not answered in the call: pcchair@ijcai24.org \n\nSummary\n\nPapers must be no longer than 9 pages in total: 7 pages for the body of the paper and 2 pages for references.\nAll authors must provide author information. All authors are expected to be available to review.\nTwo-phase reviewing:  Every paper will receive two reviews in Phase 1. Papers not rejected in Phase 1 will receive additional reviews in Phase 2 and will be able to provide an author’s response. \nSupplementary material (e.g. appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) is due one week after the paper deadline.\nPaper resubmissions from other conferences are welcome but authors are required to provide resubmission information, as described below.\nNew in 2024\n\nGenerative AI models, including Chat-GPT, BARD,  LLaMA, or similar LLMs, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published in IJCAI 2024. If authors use an LLM  in any part of the paper-writing process they assume full responsibility for all content, including checking for plagiarism and correctness of all text. \n\nWe encourage papers that describe research on or involving LLMs. Text generated by an LLM as part of the paper’s methodology or experimental analysis is allowed but needs to be properly documented and described in the paper. \n\nGeneral Information\n\nPage limit:  Papers must be no longer than 9 pages in total: 7 pages for the body of the paper and 2 pages for references; an optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages.  For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.\n\nAuthors commit to reviewing: By submitting to the conference, each author volunteers to be entered into the pool of potential PC members/reviewers for IJCAI 2024 and may be asked to review papers for the conference. This does not apply to authors who have already agreed to contribute to IJCAI 2024 in some capacity (e.g., as PC/SPC members of the main conference or special tracks, area chairs, or members of the organizing committee) and authors who are not qualified to be IJCAI PC members (e.g., undergraduate students, junior graduate students, or researchers with a limited track record in AI). This requirement may be waived in a limited range of exceptional circumstances (researchers leaving academia, parental leave, etc.)\n\nSeparate deadline for technical appendix and resubmission information: Authors are given one week after the submission deadline to update their technical appendix and resubmission information.\n\nSimplified procedure for resubmission information: Authors must declare whether their paper has been rejected from another peer-reviewed conference in the last 12 months before the submission. They will be requested to upload the latest rejected version (anonymized if necessary) with the reviewer’s comments; a cover letter responding to the reviews is optional. To avoid bias, the resubmission information will only be made available to reviewers after they submit their reviews. The program committee reserves the right to reject papers that fail to report resubmission information. Further, reviewers will be encouraged to check whether the resubmission addresses factual issues pointed out in the reviews of the previous version (e.g., typos, incorrect attribution of results, etc.) and to reject submissions that fail to do so.\n\nContribution statement: For accepted papers, the authors can include contribution information, explicitly indicating the contribution of each co-author to the paper.\n\nSelection Process\n\nSelection criteria:  Selection criteria include the novelty and originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, the significance of results, potential impact and quality of the presentation.\n\nSummary rejects: The reviewing process will proceed in two phases. In Phase 1, every paper will be reviewed by two PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response.  By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that they are aware of the possibility of receiving a summary rejection notification.\n\nFull paper review: Papers passing the summary reject step will go through the full reviewing process. Each paper will be reviewed by a group of PC members (PCs), and a Senior PC member (SPC) will coordinate the PC review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by an Area Chair (AC).\n\nAuthor response: The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews. Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors. Author responses will be visible to AC, SPC, and PCs.\n\nParticipation in the conference.  At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference and present the work. We are looking forward to the community meeting in person. \n\nEthics policy and ethics statement: Similar to the 2022 and 2023 editions of the conference, we will employ a lightweight ethics review policy for IJCAI 2024. Reviewers will be asked to flag glaring violations of ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by the Ethics Chair. In rare situations, the Program Chair, advised by the Ethics Chair, reserves the right to reject a submission on ethical grounds. However, we expect that the primary response to ethical concerns will require authors to revise their submissions to include a discussion that identifies these ethical concerns and suggestions on how they might be mitigated.\n\nAuthors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference pages, an ethics statement that addresses both ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. Note that such an ethics statement is not required, but we recommend that papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks include such discussion. The IJCAI review form will include a section asking reviewers and ACs to flag any serious ethical concerns. \n\nConflict of interest policy: All individuals involved in the IJCAI 2024 review process must adhere to the IJCAI conflict of interest policy. Details can be found at https://www.ijcai.org/IJCAI_Conflict_of_Interest_Policy.pdf. All authors of papers submitted to IJCAI 2024 agree to be bound by the conditions outlined in this call for papers (w.r.t. multiple submissions, authorship, resubmission policy, submission limit, etc.). Authors and reviewers acknowledge that IJCAI may take action against individuals in breach of the conflict of interest and call for papers policy, including – but not limited to – rejecting their submissions without further review and banning individuals from submitting their work to a limited number of IJCAI conferences in the future.\n\nConfidentiality policy: All submissions will be treated in strict confidence until the publication date.\n\nSubmission Process\n\nFormatting guidelines: The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit in December 2023.\n\nSubmission site: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2024\n\nMandatory abstract submission: The paper title, author names, contact details, and a brief abstract must be submitted electronically through the IJCAI 2024 paper submission site (link above) by the abstract submission deadline. It will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline. However, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts may be removed without consideration.\n\nAuthor Information: Full papers must be submitted through the same site by the paper submission deadline. The list of author names provided at the Author Information Deadline is final. Authors may not be added to or removed from papers following submission. (The author’s ordering may still be changed during the camera-ready period.)  All authors must fill out the author information form in the submission site by the Author Information deadline. The author’s information is important to control the COIs in the review process. A submission may be rejected without review if any co-author does not register and enter the necessary information.\n\nSubmission limit: IJCAI 2024 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8 submissions to IJCAI 2024.\n\nKeywords: When submitting abstracts, authors must choose up to three content area keywords (called “subject areas” in CMT). General categories should be used only if specific categories do not apply or do not accurately reflect the main contributions. The full list of keywords will be available on the submission site.\n\nCopyright:  IJCAI 2024 is a conference held under the IJCAI rules. The papers published there will be solely IJCAI publications with IJCAI as the copyright holder.\n\nSubmission Requirements\n\nPaper format: Papers submitted to  IJCAI 2024 must be formatted according to the IJCAI 2024 guidelines (link above). Submissions must be self-contained. Authors are required to submit their electronic papers in PDF format. Submissions that violate the  IJCAI 2024 style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) may be rejected without review.\n\nPaper length: Papers must be no longer than 9 pages in total: 7 pages for the body of the paper (including all figures/tables), plus up to 2 additional pages with references; the optional ethics statement can be placed either in the body of the paper or in the reference pages. Acknowledgments and the contribution statement can be included in the two reference pages for accepted papers. Moreover, for accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.\n\nSupplementary material: Authors may submit up to 50MB of supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be created by the authors that directly support the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. There are two entries for supplementary files in the CMT system: one is “TechnicalAppendix”, and the other one is “ResubmissionFile”. The latter should be used for providing resubmission information only. Looking at the technical appendix is at the discretion of the reviewers.\n\nAnonymity: From the authors’ perspective, reviewing for  IJCAI 2024 is double-blind. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names or affiliations in your submission and should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). Acknowledgements of funding or assistance should also be omitted at the submission stage. When referring to one’s work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say, “Previously, Kwok et al. [8] have shown that…” rather than “In our previous work [8], we have shown that…”. All identifying information can be added to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. Supplementary material (including the resubmission information) and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institutions). In case of resubmissions, if the previous version of the paper was non-anonymous, the authors are asked to remove/cover their names, affiliations and acknowledgements in the resubmission PDF but not to alter the previous version or the reviews in any other way. The authors should also remove identifying information from the PDF metadata. Submissions that violate anonymity will be rejected without further review.\n\nPreprints: The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) and prior publication in non-archival venues will not result in rejection. Note that the submission to CMT must always be anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.\n\nReproducibility: Authors must follow the reproducibility guidelines (available here) and checklist at the time of paper submission.\n\nEthics Statement: Authors may include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This part can be put in either the main body of the paper or on the reference pages. It is optional but is highly recommended for papers working with sensitive data or on sensitive tasks.\n\nDual submissions: IJCAI 2024 will not accept any paper that, at the time of full paper submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings.  Authors of IJCAI 2024 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the IJCAI 2024 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.)  These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.  \n\nNote that papers that had been submitted to ICLR 2024 are eligible for submission to IJCAI 2024 since the ICLR 2024 notifications are before the IJCAI 2024 full paper deadline. Authors of ICLR 2024 submissions who are considering resubmitting to IJCAI 2024 must provide resubmission information as described above. We strongly encourage authors to provide a cover letter explaining how they addressed concerns raised in earlier reviews."
