    "CallForPaper": "Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.\n\nThe Character of Onward! Papers\n\nOnward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.\n\nSelection Process\n\nOnward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.\n\nOnward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.\n\nWe expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.\n\nThe program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.\n\nThe second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard.\n\nInstructions for Authors\n\nFor fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.\n\nSubmission Site\n\nhttps://onward2024papers.hotcrp.com/\n\nConcurrent Submissions\n\nPapers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.\n\nPolicy on Double Blind Review\n\nOnward! 2023 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:\n\nRemove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper.\nTo the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person.\nTo the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements.\n\nAfter submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.\n\nSee OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.\n\nPolicy on Authorship Changes\n\nAny addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.\n\nFormat\n\nSubmissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.\n\nIf you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \\documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \\documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.\n\nPage Limit\n\nTo ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)\n\nPublication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)\n\nAUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\nMore Information\n\nFor additional information, clarification, or answers to questions please contact the Program Chair via onward@splashcon.org"

Previous PRICAI conferences have been held in Gold Coast (2014), Phuket (2016), Nanjing (2018), Fiji (2019), Yokohama (2020), Hanoi (2021), Shanghai (2022), and Jakarta (2023). The 21st Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2024) will be held at the Clock Tower Centennial Hall of Kyoto University in Kyoto, Japan. The Program Committee invites technical papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research in all areas of Artificial Intelligence. PRICAI 2024 aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, educators, and users in AI and related communities for in-depth intellectual exchanges, research cooperation, and professional development.\n\n \n\nPaper Submission\n\nProceedings of PRICAI 2024 will be published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) proceedings volume. PRICAI 2024 solicits regular and short papers. Regular papers may be up to 12 pages in length, including references, while short papers may be up to 6 pages, including references. All papers should be submitted electronically using the conference management tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNAI template. Submitted papers must not be published or under consideration to be published elsewhere. PRICAI reviewing follows a double-blind process. Authors are unaware of the identities of the reviewers, and reviewers cannot deduce the names of the authors from the submission. Authors must refrain from including any information that might reveal their identities anywhere in the submission. Failure to adhere to this guideline could result in rejection without review.\n\n \n\nAreas of Interest\n\nThe conference areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\nAI foundations\nAI regulations and ethics\nAgents\nApplications of AI\nBayesian networks\nBig data analytics\nBio-inspired intelligence\nBioinformatics\nCausality\nCognitive computing\nCognitive systems\nConstraint satisfaction\nData mining and knowledge discovery\nKnowledge acquisition and ontology\nKnowledge management\nKnowledge representation\nMachine learning\nMarkov networks\nMultimedia and arts\nMultimodal interaction\nNatural Language Processing\nNeural Networks and Deep Learning\nLarge Language Models\nPlanning and scheduling\nProbabilistic inference\n\n \n\nReasoning\nDecision theory\nEducation and tutoring systems\nEducation systems\nEvolutionary computation\nExplainable AI\nFoundational Models\nGame Theory\nGames and interactive entertainment\nGenerative AI\nHeuristics\nInformation retrieval\nInternet of things\nResponsible AI\nRobotics\nSearch\nSemantic Web\nSocial Choice Theory\nSocial Intelligence\nSpeech and dialogue systems\nTrustworthy AI\nText/Web/Internet mining\nUncertainty\nVision and perception\n\n \n\nProgram Co-Chairs\n\n     -Rafik Hadfi(Kyoto University, Japan)\n\n     -Patricia Anthony(Lincoln University, New Zealand)\n\n     -Alok Sharma(Riken, Japan)\n\n \n\nEmail : pricai2024@gmail.com"

AI-2023 reviews recent technical advances in AI technologies and shows how these advances have been applied to solve business problems. Key features are:\n\nPapers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) subseries of the popular Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (www.springer.com/lncs).\n\nPapers will be presented in two streams. The Technical Stream presents the best of recent developments in AI, covering a wide range of technical areas. The Application Stream is the largest annual showcase in Europe of real applications using AI technology.\n\nIt is expected that the best papers will be reprinted in a special issue of an international journal.\n\nA mixture of full papers (maximum 14 A4 pages) presented orally and short papers (maximum 6 A4 pages) presented as posters. Papers of both kinds will be included in the proceedings.\n\nPrizes for best paper and best student paper in each stream and best short paper.\n\nInvited keynote lectures.\n\nThe first day comprises tutorials and workshops to provide greater depth in selected topics. (Separate one-day registration for this day is also available.)\n\nA panel session on a topical subject.\n\nAn 'AI Open Mic' session to allow delegates to have their say about any aspect of AI.\n\nIn addition to the formal sessions, the conference programme includes a welcome reception and a Gala Dinner.\nAI-2023 offers a valuable opportunity to keep up to date with developments in AI and to share experiences in the practical issues of developing AI systems.\n\nFAIRS '23, the fifteenth annual forum for AI research students will immediately precede the AI-2023 conference at Peterhouse College on Monday December 11th, 2023. The aim of FAIRS is to support student members of the AI community providing advice and feedback on their research plans and work. This event is free of charge for research students except for a contribution towards the cost of refreshments and lunch in the College and no conference registration is required.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nPaper/Poster Submission: Extended to Monday July 17th 2023 at 5 p.m. (UK time)\n\nNotification of Acceptance: Tuesday 29th August 2023\n\nCamera Ready Paper: Tuesday 12th September 2023\nCONTRIBUTIONS\n\nContributions presenting original work in AI are invited for both the technical and the application stream. Contributions may be submitted either as full papers of up to fourteen A4 pages for oral presentation or as short papers of up to six A4 pages for poster presentation.\n\nTechnical Stream\n\nAreas of interest include (but are not restricted to): knowledge engineering; semantic web; constraint satisfaction; intelligent agents; machine learning; model based reasoning; verification and validation of AI systems; natural language understanding; speech-enabled systems; case based reasoning; neural networks; genetic algorithms; data mining and knowledge discovery in databases; knowledge representation, inference and reasoning; robotics and pervasive computing; qualitative and temporal reasoning; knowledge management; AI languages and environments; robotics and pervasive computing.\n\nApplication Stream\n\nCase studies are welcomed describing the application of AI to real-world problems. Papers in recent years have covered all application domains, including commerce, manufacturing and government, and every major AI technique. In addition to case studies and specific applications of AI, we would welcome papers that discuss issues such as managing the transfer from research to production of AI-based products. Papers are selected to highlight critical areas of success (and failure) and to present the benefits and lessons of value to other developers. Submitted papers should make these points clear.\n\nShort Papers for Poster Presentation\n\nShort papers are intended for the presentation of work which meets the high standards of the conference, but which is more topical and preliminary than the work presented in full papers. They provide an excellent forum for disseminating new developments and latest work in progress, especially suited to PhD students. Work submitted in the form of full-length papers that fall short of the standard for oral presentation will automatically be considered as candidates for reworking as short papers for poster presentation.\n\nSubmission of Papers\n\nFinal versions of accepted papers must be prepared in either Microsoft Word or Latex together with a copy in PDF format. Initial versions of papers should be submitted in PDF format only and uploaded to the conference website by the deadline given above.\n\nInstructions for authors, style files and templates for both Word and Latex are given by the publisher at its Information for Authors of Computer Science Proceedings page.\n\nIn order for an accepted paper to be published at least one author must register for the conference and undertake to attend and present the paper in person. Presenting authors will be asked to register for the conference at the discounted speakers' rate when they return the final camera-ready versions of their papers.\n\nTutorials & workshops\n\nThe Conference Committee invites proposals for tutorials and workshops to be presented on the first day of the conference. These should be directed in the first instance to the Tutorial/Workshop Organiser.\n\nPrizes\n\nThere are prizes for the best paper and best student paper submitted in each stream, chosen by the relevant program committee, and also a prize for the best short paper, awarded on the basis of delegate voting.\n\nAll further information including details of the conference committee, program committees, paper format and uploading instructions is given on the conference website.\n\nALL CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BE SENT BY EMAIL TO THE CONFERENCE SECRETARIAT: sgai-conference@bcs.org.uk\n"

    "CallForPaper": "SSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the design and development of distributed systems with a focus on systems that are able to provide guarantees on their structure, performance, and/or security in the face of an adverse operational environment. The symposium encourages submissions of original contributions on fundamental research and practical applications concerning topics in the four symposium tracks:\n\nTrack A. Self-Stabilizing and/or Dynamic Systems: Theory and Practice\nSelf-stabilizing systems\nSelf-stabilizing protocols and algorithms\nPractically-stabilizing systems\nVariants of self-stabilization\nTopological stabilization\nAutonomic Computing\nStabilization and self-* properties in hardware, software, and middleware design\nSelf-stabilizing software-defined infrastructure\nDynamic networks, time-varying graphs, evolving graphs\nTrack B. Distributed and Concurrent Computing: Foundations, Fault-Tolerance and Scalability\nDistributed, concurrent, and fault-tolerant algorithms\nSynchronization protocols\nShared and transactional memory\nGraph-theoretic concepts for communication networks\nFormal methods, validation, verification, and synthesis\nSocial networks\nGame-theory and economical aspects of distributed computing\nRandomization in distributed computing\nHigh-performance, cluster, cloud and grid computing\nNetwork security and privacy\nBlockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies\nApplied cryptography\nTrack C. Cryptography and Security\nCryptographic designs, implementation analysis, and construction methods\nSecure multi-party computation and cryptographic distributed protocols\nPrivacy-enhancing technologies and anonymity\nPost-quantum and information theoretic cryptography and security\nSecure software and secure programming methodologies\nFormal methods, semantics and verification of secure systems\nFault tolerance, reliability, availability of distributed secure systems\nGame-theoretic approaches to secure computing\nCommunication and internet: security, authentication and identification\nCybersecurity for hardware components, mobile, cyber-physical systems, and internet of things\nCybersecurity of corporations (applications, end points, and cloud)\nSecurity and privacy for web applications\nSecurity of edge and fog computing\nCryptocurrency and Blockchains\nTrack D. Moving and Computing\nMobile agents\nAutonomous mobile robots\nMobile sensor networks\nMobile ad-hoc networks\nPopulation protocols\nNature-inspired computing\nProgrammable particles, nanoscale robots, biological systems, and related new models\nNew Conference Model\n\nWe experiment with a new conference model. There will be TWO deadlines. The review process for these two deadlines will not overlap to allow papers rejected during the first review phase to be reworked, corrected, and enhanced before being resubmitted on the second review round, if wished by the authors. Papers may be submitted at only one deadline. Of course, accepted papers of the first review round are definitely accepted and should not be submitted to the second round. In case of resubmission, reviews from the first phase will be transmitted to the reviewers of the second phase.\n\nPaper Submission\n\nPapers are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair. All submissions must conform to the formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series. Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format.\n\nDouble-blind Review\n\nAll submissions must be anonymous. We use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double- blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identities of the authors. Please feel free to ask the general co-chairs if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of SSS 2024.\n\nSubmissions\n\nThere are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements.\n\nA regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title, abstract, figures, and references).\nA brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages and should not include any appendix.\nAdditional necessary details for an expert to verify the main claims of the submission may be included in a clearly marked appendix if extra space is needed. Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of its merits. It is recommended that a regular submission begins with a succinct statement of the problem being addressed, a summary of the main results or conclusions, a brief explanation of their significance, a brief statement of the key ideas, and a comparison with related work, all tailored to a non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the specialist, should follow. Papers outside of the conference scope will be rejected without review. For the second round only, if requested by the authors on the cover page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement format. This will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular presentation.\n\nPublication\n\nRegular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series.\n\nSpecial Issue\n\nExtended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of Theoretical Computer Science (TCS)\n\nPaper Award\n\nPrizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper. A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission time. Authors should clearly indicate whether their submission is eligible to be considered for the best student paper award (e.g., using a \\thanks in the title). The PC may decline to confer awards or may split awards."

    "CallForPaper": "VMCAI 2024 is the 25th International Conference on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation. The conference will be held during January 15-16, 2024. VMCAI provides a forum for researchers from the communities of Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating interaction, cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that combine these and related areas.\n\nScope\n\nThe program will consist of refereed research papers as well as invited lectures and tutorials. Research contributions can report new results as well as experimental evaluations and comparisons of existing techniques.\n\nTopics include, but are not limited to:\n\nProgram Verification\nModel Checking\nAbstract Interpretation\nAbstract Domains\nProgram Synthesis\nStatic Analysis\nType Systems\nDeductive Methods\nProgram Logics\nFirst-Order Theories\nDecision Procedures\nInterpolation\nHorn Clause Solving\nProgram Certification\nSeparation Logic\nProbabilistic Programming and Analysis\nError Diagnosis\nDetection of Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities\nProgram Transformations\nHybrid and Cyber-physical Systems\nConcurrent and distributed Systems\nAnalysis of numerical properties\nAnalysis of smart contracts\nAnalysis of neural networks\nCase Studies on all of the above topics\n\nSubmissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic, and object-oriented programming.\n\nImportant Dates AoE (UTC-12)\n\nSeptember 7th (extended) August 31st: Paper submission\n\nOctober 11th, 2023: Notification\n\nNovember 2nd, 2023: Camera-ready version due\n\nSubmissions\n\nSubmissions are required to follow Springer’s LNCS format. The page limit depends on the paper’s category (see below). In each category, additional material beyond the page limit may be placed in a clearly marked appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers and to be omitted in the final version. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website. Submission is via EasyChair.\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The corresponding author of each paper will need to complete and sign a License-to-Publish form to be submitted together with the camera-ready version.\n\nSubmissions will undergo a single-blind review process. There will be three categories of papers: regular papers, tool papers and case studies. Papers in each category have a different page limit and will be evaluated differently.\n\nRegular papers clearly identify and justify an advance to the field of verification, abstract interpretation, or model checking. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Regular papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.\n\nTool papers present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations with relevant citations, and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture and core data structures. A regular tool paper should give a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, describe experience with realistic case studies, and where applicable, provide a rigorous experimental evaluation. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly focus on the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, preferably substantiated by data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available and submit an artifact. Tool papers are restricted to 12 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.\n\nCase studies are expected to describe the use of verification, model checking, and abstract interpretation techniques in new application domains or industrial settings. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to present original research results but are expected to contain novel applications of formal methods techniques as well as an evaluation of these techniques in the chosen application domain. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting and reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience. Case study papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references. (Shorter case study papers are also welcome.)"
