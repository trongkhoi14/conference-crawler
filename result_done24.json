    "CallForPaper":"PPoPP 2024: 29th ACM SIGPLAN Annual Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming\n\nLocation: Edinburgh, United Kingdom. (collocated with CC-2024, HPCA-2024 and CGO-2024) Dates: 02 - 06 March, 2024.\n\nSubmission URL: https://ppopp24.hotcrp.com\n\nImportant dates:\nFull paper submission: Friday, August 4, 2023\nAuthor response period: Wednesday, October 18 – Friday, October 20, 2023\nAuthor notification: Friday, November 10, 2023\nFinal paper due: January 17, 2024\nScope:\n\nPPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; accelerators such as ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs; data centers; clouds; and large scale machines). PPoPP is interested in all aspects related to improving the productivity of parallel programming on modern architectures. PPoPP is also interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of large-scale scientific or enterprise workloads.\n\nSpecific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\nLanguages, compilers, and runtimes for parallel systems\nConcurrent data structures\nDevelopment, analysis, or management tools\nFault tolerance for parallel systems\nFormal analysis and verification\nHigh-performance libraries\nMiddleware for parallel systems\nMachine learning for parallel systems\nParallel algorithms\nParallel applications including scientific computing (e.g., simulation and modeling) and enterprise workloads (e.g., web, search, analytics, cloud, and machine learning)\nParallel frameworks\nParallel programming for deep memory hierarchies including nonvolatile memory\nParallel programming theory and models\nPerformance analysis, debugging and optimization\nProductivity tools for parallel systems\nSoftware engineering for parallel programs\nSynchronization and concurrency control\n\nPapers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.\n\nPaper Submission:\n\nConference submission site: https://ppopp24.hotcrp.com\n\nAll submissions must be made electronically through the conference web site and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter size paper.\n\nAll papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column acmart format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex for Latex, and interim-layout.docx for Word. You may also want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template and related tools. Important note: The Word template (interim-layout.docx) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.\n\nPapers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10 point) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references and they must include the name of all authors (not {et al.}). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.\n\nSubmission is double blind and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/ (ACM SIGPLAN policy).\n\nPPoPP 2024 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.\n\nTo facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2024 may utilize the [Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS)]{(http://torontopapermatching.org/) to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to the TPMS.\n\nSubmissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, that deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.\n\nAll submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.\n\nTo allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification, and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance, but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive one or several of the ACM reproducibility badges, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.\n\nDeadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.\n\nPublication Date:\n\nThe titles of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the author notification date (late November 2023). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will make the proceedings available via the Digital Library for one month, up to 2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\nACM Publications Policies:\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\" https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects\n\nPlease ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. Please follow the https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmcgit/author-guidelines link to see ACM’s ORCID requirements for authors."

    "CallForPaper": "24th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2024)\n\nJuly 15–20, 2024\n\nBristol, UK and Online\nThe annual Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) brings together experts from around the world to present and discuss recent advances and new perspectives on research in privacy technologies. The 24th PETS will be a hybrid event with a physical gathering held in Bristol, UK and a concurrent virtual event. Papers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings. We will carefully monitor the COVID-19 situation, and may change the organization of the event as necessary\n\nPoPETs, a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy, provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges (APCs) or article submission charges.\n\nAuthors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months, and are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. In addition to accept and reject decisions, papers may receive resubmit with major revisions decisions, in which case authors are invited to revise and resubmit their article to one of the following two issues. We endeavour to assign the same reviewers to major revisions. Please view our FAQ for more information about the process.\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\n\nThe submission guidelines contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions and for ensuring ethical research. Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2024 submission server. The submission URL is: https://submit.petsymposium.org/.\n\nImportant Dates for PETS 2024\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)\n\nIssue 1\nPaper submission deadline: May 31, 2023 (firm)\nRebuttal period: July 17–21, 2023\nAuthor notification: August 1, 2023\nCamera-ready deadline for accepted papers and minor revisions (if accepted by the shepherd): September 15, 2023\n\n\nIssue 2\nPaper submission deadline: August 31, 2023 (firm)\nRebuttal period: October 16–20, 2023\nAuthor notification: November 1, 2023\nCamera-ready deadline for accepted papers and minor revisions (if accepted by the shepherd): December 15, 2023\n\n\nIssue 3\nPaper submission deadline: November 30, 2023 (firm)\nRebuttal period: January 15–19, 2024\nAuthor notification: February 1, 2024\nCamera-ready deadline for accepted papers and minor revisions (if accepted by the shepherd): March 15, 2024\n\n\nIssue 4\nPaper submission deadline: February 29, 2024 (firm)\nRebuttal period: April 8–12, 2024\nAuthor notification: May 1, 2024\nCamera-ready deadline for accepted papers and minor revisions (if accepted by the shepherd): June 15, 2024\n\n\nAuthors invited to resubmit with major revisions can submit the revised (full) paper two weeks after the stated deadline. Such papers must, however, be registered with an abstract by the usual deadline. All papers other than major revision resubmissions must be submitted in full by the stated deadline, including papers submitted to and rejected from previous issues. To benefit from the two-week deadline extension, major revisions must be submitted to one of the two issues following the decision. Major revisions submitted to later issues are treated as new submissions, due by the regular deadline and possibly assigned to new reviewers.\n\nScope\n\nPapers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal, or situational contexts in which they are used. Note that a paper's relevance to privacy applications is crucial for our community. PETS is open to topics from the wider area of security and privacy (cryptographic primitives, security mechanisms, differentially-private mechanisms, etc.) as long as it is clear how these serve to improve or understand privacy in technology (e.g., it includes a use case, evaluation on real data, integration with an application, etc.). PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs, preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.\n\nSuggested topics include but are not restricted to:\nAnonymous communication and censorship resistance\nBlockchain privacy\nBuilding and deploying privacy-enhancing systems\nCloud computing and privacy\nCryptographic tools for privacy\nData protection technologies\nDefining and quantifying privacy\nDifferential privacy and private data analysis\nEconomics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy\nForensics and privacy\nGenomic and medical privacy\nHuman factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies\nInformation leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy\nInterdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc.\nInternet of Things privacy\nLocation privacy\nMachine learning and privacy\nMeasurement of privacy in real-world systems\nMobile devices and privacy\nPolicy languages and tools for privacy\nProfiling and data mining\nSocial network privacy\nSurveillance\nTraffic analysis\nTransparency, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems\nWeb privacy\n\nWe also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on any of these topics: papers putting together existing knowledge under some common light (adversary model, requirements, functionality offered, etc.), providing novel insights, identifying research gaps or challenges to commonly held assumptions, etc. Survey papers, without such contributions, are not suitable. SoK submissions should include \"SoK:\" in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.\n\nGeneral Chair (gc24@petsymposium.org)\nAwais Rashid, University of Bristol\nProgram Chairs/Co-Editors-in-Chief (pets24-chairs@petsymposium.org)\nZubair Shafiq, University of California, Davis\nMicah Sherr, Georgetown University\nVice Program Chairs/Associate Editors-in-Chief\nGunes Acar, Radboud University\nSadia Afroz, ICSI\nAnna Maria Mandalari, Imperial College London\nRebekah Overdorf, University of Lausanne\nPaul Syverson, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory\nProgram Committee/Editorial Board:\nRuba Abu-Salma, King’s College London\nOmer Akgul, University of Maryland\nEman Alashwali, King Abdulaziz University (KAU) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)\nGhada Almashaqbeh, University of Connecticut\nMário Alvim, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais - UFMG\nHéber H.

    "CallForPaper": "Scope of the Conference\n\nThe IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems including theory, design, analysis, implementation, evaluation, and experience. RTSS’24, the 45th edition of the event, continues the trend of making RTSS an expansive and inclusive event, striving to embrace new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.\n\nRTSS’24 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either the real-time systems track (Track 1) or the design and applications track (Track 2), which covers Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT). To be in scope, ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements/constraints. Classical examples of real-time requirements include (but are not limited to) deadlines, response time, or delay/latency. Other forms of real-time requirements may be considered in scope if the submission provides a comprehensive and compelling justification that the problem requires some non-trivial resource allocation, programming approach, scheduling, or design approach to satisfy those real-time requirements. As an example, improving the average-case performance of a program without regard to other criteria is not considered as addressing a real-time requirement. However, improving the average-case performance while simultaneous ensuring that the worst-case performance or execution time variability is not made worse, is considered as addressing a real-time requirement, since it facilitates the development of quantifiably better real-time systems.\n\nRTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics that address aspects of real-time requirements as stated above. Such topics may include machine learning techniques for the design and analysis of real-time systems, system design approaches for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators, etc.\n\nNote the above list of topics is intended only as a rough guide and should not be understood as an exclusive list. Papers breaking new ground, departing from established subfields, or challenging the status quo are most welcome and are encouraged.\n\nEmpirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome. This type of research uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques to obtain information about the past / current / future state of play in the research, design, development, verification, validation, and deployment of real-time systems. (Note literature surveys that classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope of the conference).\n\nAll accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings. A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. Best paper and best student paper awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation. (Note that submissions are eligible for the best student paper award provided that the first author is a student as of the submission deadline).\n\nTrack 1: Real-Time Systems Track\n\nThe objective of this track is to promote cutting-edge research in real-time systems, especially new and emerging topics. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: operating systems, networks, middleware, compilers, tools, scheduling, QoS support, resource management, testing and debugging, design and verification, modeling, WCET analysis, performance analysis, fault tolerance, security, and system experimentation and deployment experiences.\n\nTrack 2: Design and Applications Track\n\nThis track aims to highlight novel research pertaining to designs, implementations and applications that attend to some aspect of real-time requirements. Continuing with the success in previous years, the track will particularly focus on three specialized areas:\n\nCyber-Physical Systems\n\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS) encompass a broad scope such as safety-critical, autonomous, or robotic systems. CPS applications (such as transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc.) interact with the physical world. Hence, they do possess real-time requirements. Papers that identify scientific foundations and technologies that advance the state-of-the-art for CPS are welcome. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) foundations of CPS, design methods, simulation/emulation for CPS, tool chains, CPS architectures, embedded machine-learning implementation, security, performance analysis, robustness, safety assessment, and hardware/software compositions.\n\nHW-SW Integration and System–Level Design\n\nThis area focuses on design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design of modern embedded systems for real-time applications. Topics include (but are not limited to) architecture description languages and tools, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, and optimization. Of special interest are SoC design for real-time applications, special-purpose functional units, specialized memory structures, multi-core chips and communication aspects, FPGA simulation and prototyping, software simulation and compilation for novel architectures and applications, as well as power, thermal, timing and predictability analyses.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\n\nGrand challenges in IoT include extremely constrained resources (energy supply, storage, and computational power) in IoT devices, unprecedented scalability requirements as well as uncertain dynamics in their operating environments. Submissions that build on solid theoretical foundations, present empirical development, and experimental evaluations for empowering IoT applications with real-time requirements are welcome.\n\nPaper Submissions\nSubmitted papers must describe original work not previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere. Papers based on previous work presented at workshops are eligible for submission – if the workshop paper has a digital object identifier (DOI) then the submission must contain at least 30% new material. All submitted papers must comply with the double-blind submission requirements. The main body of each submitted paper is limited to 11 pages of technical content with additional pages permitted for bibliography only. Submissions must be formatted according to IEEE conference paper guidelines."

HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.\n\nWe solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over a “6-pages conference paper.”\n\nWe take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes:\n\nNovel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility.\nOperating system and distributed system support for mobile computing.\nWearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness.\nHCI issues related to mobile computing.\nSecurity and privacy of mobile computing.\nManagement, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility.\nWireless technology, as it pertains to mobile systems and applications.\nSocial issues related to mobile computing.\n\nImportant dates:\n\nDeadline for submissions: October 6th, 2023, 11:59pm AoE\nDeadline for submissions (extended): October 13th, 2023, 11:59pm AoE\nAcceptance notification: December 15th, 2023"

Also, the authors can submit their arXiv papers in ICPR-2024\nPaper Format and Length\nSpringer LNCS format with maximum 15 pages (including references) during paper submission. There is no minimum page limit. To take care of reviewers' comments, one more page is allowed (without any charge) during revised/camera ready submission. Moreover, authors may purchase up to 2 extra pages. Extra page charges must be paid at the time of registration\n\nSpringer LNCS paper formatting instructions and templates for ICPR-2024 are available here DOC and Latex\n\n\n\nParticipation and Paper Presentation Mode\nICPR 2024 will be held in hybrid mode. However the organizer of ICPR encouraged the participants to attend the conference physically. Each accepted paper should have at least one author registration at the full rate (member or non-member). A full rate registration can cover a maximum of two papers (it may be two main conference papers, or one main conference paper and one workshop paper). Student registration only allows attending the conference and presenting papers, does not allow including paper in the proceedings. If an author cannot attend physically after registration, a proxy can be entrusted to present the paper physically. Otherwise, the authors can present it online. All no-show papers will be excluded from the conference proceedings.\n\nRegistration for virtual attention only allows listening to the talks and accessing the papers, and does not allow presenting papers virtually.\n\nSupplementary materials:\nBy the submission deadline, the authors may optionally submit additional material that was ready at the time of paper submission but could not be included due to constraints of format or space. The authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material appropriately in the paper. Reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so.\n\nSupplementary material may include videos, proofs, additional figures or tables, more detailed analysis of experiments presented in the paper. There is no page limit for the supplementary materials but only one file with maximum file size of 50 MB is allowed for submission.\n\nWe encourage (if possible) authors to upload their code as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work.\n"

    "CallForPaper": "Thirtieth Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, CP 2024\n\nSeptember 2-6, 2024, Girona, Spain\n\nThe CP conference is the premier international event for presenting research in all aspects of computing with constraints, including, but not restricted to: theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, and applications. CP 2024 will be the 30th edition of the CP conference and will be held in the historic city of Girona on the University of Girona campus, September 2-6, 2024.\n\nThe conference welcomes submissions that advance the state of the art of fundamental constraint-based technologies, as well as those that seek connections with other domains: for example, operations research, satisfiability, computational biology, configuration and design, computer music, entertainment, sport, cybersecurity, and AI in its broader context.\n\nTracks\n\nBesides the main technical track, CP 2024 especially encourages submission to three additional specialized tracks: Application track, CP and Machine Learning track and CP and Quantum Computing track. A paper may only be submitted to either the main technical track or at most one specialized track. Special track papers will undergo the same review and publication process as that of the main technical track.\n\nApplication Track\nThe Application track of the International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming targets papers that showcase the practical applications of constraint programming. These include innovative uses in various fields, such as operations research, machine learning, computational sustainability, and cybersecurity. The track is particularly interested in contributions that demonstrate the effectiveness of constraint programming in solving real-world problems, highlighting advancements in technology and applications that extend beyond traditional approaches.\n\nIn Essence, if the main track focuses on the scientific contributions made “to” CP, the Application track focuses on scientific contributions made “with” CP.\n\n\nCP and Machine Learning Track\nThis track is dedicated to papers using machine learning approaches to improve CP solvers (e.g., learning branching heuristics, leveraging past data, solving quickly sub-problems, etc.) and, on the other side, to papers using CP to improve machine learning algorithms (e.g., providing guarantees on predictions, constraining the search space of the optimization algorithm, etc.).\n\n\nCP and Quantum Computing Track\nAs the development of quantum computers is gaining momentum, the Constraint Programming and Quantum Computing track aims at encouraging the cross-fertilization between these two fields, both in the use of quantum computing in order to solve constrained optimization problems and in the use of constraint programming to tackle problems in the design and implementation of quantum systems.\n\nPossible topics include, but are not limited to: quantum algorithms for constraint satisfaction and optimization problems, constraint formulations in QUBO and Ising models, experiments with Quantum Annealing and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for solving constraint problems, design and development of quantum, quantum-inspired and hybrid solvers, Constraint Programming for optimizing quantum circuits.\n\n\nImportant Dates\nAbstract registration: 18/04\nPaper submission: 23/04 26/04\nAuthor rebuttal: 29/05-02/06\nFinal notification: 20/06\nCamera Ready: 01/07\nConference: September 2-6, 2024\n\nDates should be considered as Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\nSubmission Instructions\n\nThe submission Web page for CP2024 is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cp2024.\n\nPapers should be submitted in the form of a PDF file following LIPIcs guidelines. Authors should carefully follow the formatting instructions and keep to the style defined by LIPIcs. Papers should also be readable in black and white.\n\nTo open the conference more widely, two types of submissions are expected:\n\n\nFull papers, that can use up to 15 pages (references and appendices excluded).\nShort papers, that can use a maximum of 8 pages (references and appendices excluded).\n\nShort papers cover early results or results that can be adequately reported in 8 pages. They must nonetheless respect the quality expectations of the conference. Both full and short papers should attract a wide audience and will be allocated time for presentation during the conference.\n\nAppendices may be included and will not contribute towards the total page count, although the program chair reserves the right to limit the number of pages in extreme cases. Supplemental material (for example, experimental results or code) may be referenced, but only if this can be done in a manner which would not reveal the authors' identities (see below on the double-blind review process). Papers should be self-contained and be comprehensible without reference to either appendices or supplemental material. Authors should not place elements essential to their paper in either appendices or supplemental material and indeed it will be left to the discretion of each reviewer whether they refer to this material or not.\n\nSubmissions exceeding the page limits or improperly formatted will be rejected without review.\n\nTo facilitate reviewing management, authors who intend to submit a paper to CP 2024 should submit an abstract of up to 150 words, summarizing the contribution of the paper, by the 18th of April, 2024. The paper submission must be completed by the 23rd of April, 2024.\n\nAll papers will go through a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that authors and reviewers are mutually anonymous. For this reason, submitted papers should not contain author names, affiliations, or links to identifying websites. References to the authors' own papers should be cited in such a way so as to avoid revealing the authorship of the paper.\n\nA given paper must be submitted to one track only. When necessary, the Program Chair may move a submission to a more suitable track.\n\nSubmitted papers must not appear in, be accepted for, or be under review for a journal or another peer-reviewed conference with archived conference proceedings. Submissions that have appeared at workshops or other meetings and have not been formally published or have appeared only in highly shortened form (e.g., abstracts) can be submitted as papers.\n\nProceedings\n\nAccepted papers will appear in conference proceedings published by LIPIcs. The proceedings will be available at the time of the conference.\n\nJournal Publications\n\nHigh quality accepted papers will be invited to submit a journal version to Constraints.\n\nTop papers from CP 2024 will be invited to the award-winning paper tracks in Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or Journal of Artifical Intelligence Research (JAIR) (more information).\n\nOther Information\n\nQuestions about the paper submission process may be addressed to the Program Chair, Paul Shaw (cp2024@easychair.org)."

    "CallForPaper": "RCIS aims to bring together scientists, researchers, engineers, and practitioners from information science in a wide sense. First arranged in 2007, the RCIS conference series aims to provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and dissemination in areas such as information systems and their engineering, user-oriented approaches, data and information management, enterprise management and engineering, domain-specific IS engineering, data science, information infrastructures, and reflective research and practice..\n\n“Information Science: Evolution or Revolution?” Knowledge and technology are constantly evolving as a result of research & development, including in Information Science. However, recent fast progress in areas such as AI, quantum computing, and augmented reality might lead to a revolution in a short time, not only to an evolution. How we collect and use information might radically change. The impact, challenges, and concerns of the use of advanced AI (e.g., large language models), more powerful computing systems, and new digital worlds are common topics in our discussions nowadays. They also affect other areas, including security, ethics, and education. Is a revolution about to happen? Or is it only a new evolution? Will this depend on the Information Science areas in which progress is made or those affected? What role will base technologies such as data quality models, machine learning, conceptual models, and ontologies play? What will standards and best practices need to consider?\nTopics of Interest\nRCIS 2024 welcomes submissions from the whole spectrum of the information science field. The list of themes and topics includes, but is not limited to:\n\n\n\nInformation Systems and their Engineering\nRequirements Engineering\nModel-Driven Engineering\nWeb-Based Applications and Services\nData-Driven (R)evolution\nMethod Engineering\n\tUser-Oriented Approaches\nSocial Computing and Social Network Analysis\nUser-Centred Design\nCollaborative Computing\nHuman Factors in Information Systems\n\nData and Information Management\nDatabases and Information\nInformation Search and Discovery\nInformation Security and Risk Management\nConceptual Modelling and Ontologies\nKnowledge Graphs\n\tEnterprise Management and Engineering\nBusiness Process Engineering and Management\nProcess Mining\nEnterprise Modelling\nDigital Transformation\n\nDomain-specific IS Engineering\nE-Health, E-Government, and E-Commerce\nSmart Cities\nIndustry 4.0\nNews and Media Production\nDigital Humanities\nVirtual Worlds\n\tData Science\nBig Data and Business Analytics\nDecision Information Systems\nMachine-Learning Applications\nKnowledge Discovery and Management\nInformation and Value Management\nMisinformation and Fake News\n\nInformation Infrastructures\nInformation Systems for an Information Science Revolution\nCyber-Physical Systems\nWeb Information Systems\nGrid, Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing\nInternet of Things\nPervasive and Mobile Computing\nQuantum Computing\n\tReflective Research and Practice\nResponsible Research in and for an Information Science Revolution\nImpact of Information on the Enterprise and the Individual\nInformation Science Education\nResearch Methodologies in Information Science\nLifecycle Models\nDesign Science and Rationale\nAction Research and Case Studies in Information Science\nSubmission Process\n\nThe proceedings of RCIS 2024 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing series.

    "CallForPaper": "ICSSP 2024 will be held from 4-6 September 2024\n\nICSSP 2024 will take place from September 4-6, 2024, in Munich, Germany, as a hybrid event.\n\nICSSP 2024 is the 18th in a series of ICSSP conferences that have been organized by the International Software and Systems Process Association (ISSPA) or its predecessor, the International Software Process Association (ISPA). The ICSSP series grew out of two earlier and partly overlapping series, the International Conferences on Software Process (ICSP), dating back to 1991, and the International Software Process Workshops (ISPW), dating back to 1984.\n\nRecent ICSSP conferences have been organized with or around ICSE, with proceedings published by IEEE or ACM. After two ICSSP conferences co-organized with the International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE) in 2021 and 2022, and with CSRIO’s Data61 unit in 2023, in 2024 ICSSP is pleased to be joining forces with the European System, Software & Service Process Improvement & Innovation (EuroSPI2) conference.\n\nConference Theme\n\nThe theme for ICSSP 2024 is Sustainable Development.\n\nIn 2015, United Nations Member states adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, that defines 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve “peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future”. These goals address issues related to equality, health, education, the natural and built environment, and economic growth.\n\nTopics\n\nGeneral contributions that address best emerging practice in software and systems engineering are welcome. In addition, we are especially interested in software and systems processes research that addresses sustainable development, such as:\n\nPoverty, hunger, and health\nClean energy, clean water, and sanitation\nEquality, justice, peace\nClimate action\nSustainable consumption, production, innovation, and infrastructure\n\n \n\nExamples of  topics to address sustainable development goals in and through software and systems engineering include, but are not limited to:\n\nAgile and other methods for sustainable global development\nTechniques to address bias and inclusion in software development ecosystems and software products (especially those incorporating AI and/or machine learning)\nGreen software and systems engineering\nOpen Science and Open Data\nDeveloping trust and integrity\nProcesses for digital public infrastructure, FutureGov, education, food systems transformation, and energy\nGamification of sustainable development goals\nSustainable software development\nProcesses related to distributed and hybrid working\nCloud infrastructure and program optimization that address improved power consumption\nAI based software engineering\nAlignment of AI with sustainable development\nSoftware and AI enabled smart homes/living\nMigrating software applications and systems to more sustainable infrastructure\nRegulation for socially-critical software systems development\nSoftware processes to achieve better work-life balance in software engineering\nIssues related to gender, racial, or age equity in software and systems processes\nNovel applications of software/systems process engineering to physical processes\n\n \n\nFeel free to contact the PC Co-Chairs if you are not sure whether or not your paper fits the scope of ICSSP 2024. \n\nSubmissions\n\nSubmissions are invited for unpublished original work in the following categories:\n\nResearch Papers\n\nFull Papers (10 pages + up to 2 pages of references) that reflect completed and evaluated research on novel approaches to major software and systems process challenges, especially relating to the Software and System Processes for sustainable development goals.\n\nExperience Papers\n\nFull Papers (10 pages + up to 2 pages of references) with a strong focus on the real-world application of techniques, tools, methodologies, processes, and practices. Submissions should clearly identify the problem that is addressed, the context, and the outcomes, as well as the expected learning for the audience.\n\nShort Papers\n\nShort Papers (5 pages including references) that present concise research results, describe work-in-progress (e.g. Ph.D. research), or conceptual and position papers addressing new perspectives, open questions and future directions. Short papers can also be from industrial or other settings, describing, for instance, practical challenges and approaches, or research needs motivated by experience.\n\nTalk Proposals\n\nLong abstracts (2 pages) addressing ongoing activities and initiatives in industry, government, research institutes, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other organizations.  Talks should be related to the development of software and systems, or to the application of software and systems engineering practices to other domains, and should reference applications to sustainable development goals.\n\nImportant Dates\n•  EXTENDED Submission deadline\n: Friday, 29 March 2024 (Originally: 22 March 2024)\n•  EXTENDED Paper acceptance notification\n: Tuesday, 7 May 2024 (Originally: 30 April 2024)\n•  EXTENDED Camera-ready copy due\n: Friday, 14 June 2024 (Originally: 7 June 2024)\n•  Early registration deadline\n: Saturday, 30 June 2024\n•  Last day to upload conference presentation\n: Friday, 30 August 2024\nSubmission Requirements and Policies\n\nAll submissions must conform to the ICSSP 2024 formatting and submission instructions and must not exceed the given page limits for the applicable type of submission. All submissions must be in English. Page limits include all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limit is strict: purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed at any point in the process (including after the paper is accepted). All submissions must be in PDF.\n\nAuthorship\nAll submissions must respect the ACM Policy on Authorship (as approved by the ACM Publications Board on April 20, 2023). Note that this policy includes the following statement on the use of Generative AI: Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.\nFormat\n\nSubmissions must conform to the ACM Primary Article Template. Follow the instructions for preparing conference submissions using either the Word or LaTeX templates.\n\nLaTeX users please set document class as \\documentclass[sigconf,screen,review]{acmart}.\n\nFor information on using LaTeX for ACM submissions you may consult “LATEX Class for the Association for Computing Machinery.”\n\nSubmission Process\n\nSubmissions must be made through the ICSSP 2024 EasyChair site.\n\nSubmissions must be made no later than the applicable submission deadline. Be sure to direct your submissions correctly and select the appropriate submission type when uploading your submission. We encourage authors who intend to submit to upload their paper information early (ahead of the PDF file) to support the management of the review process. Note that PDF files can be submitted and updated any time ahead of the final submission deadline.\n\nReviewing\n\nAll submissions will be peer-reviewed by the ICSSP 2024 program committee members. Each submitted research paper will receive reviews from at least three members of the specific program committee. ICSSP 2024 does not employ a double-blind review process.\n\nReviewing for ICSSP 2024 will be subject to the ACM Peer Review Policy (as approved by the ACM Publications Board on November 30, 2023).\n\nNote that the policy includes the following statement on ethical standards:\n\nReviewers, authors, and decision makers all agree to adhere to the highest ethical standards for peer review.\n\nAnd the following statement on bias:\n\nACM requires that the peer review process and related decisions be free of bias based on nationality, religious or political beliefs, gender or other demographic characteristics, personal or professional conflicts or competing interests (see ACM’s Conflict of Interest Policy) or any bias that would prevent the reviewer or decision maker from providing a fair and honest review and publication decision based on the quality, relevance, and/or importance of the submitted Work.\n\nRequirement to Register, Attend, and Present\n\nUpon notification of acceptance, authors of accepted papers will be asked to complete a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for and attend ICSSP 2024 and present their work. Although we encourage authors to attend the conference in person, virtual attendance is also possible. The organizers have the right to withdraw papers from the proceedings if there is no associated registration by two weeks past the authors’ registration deadline.\n\nOpen Science Policy\n\nICSSP 2024 encourages authors to submit artifact packages and/or data sets with their papers, for the sake of transparency, reusability, replicability, and/or reproducibility, as well as for facilitating the peer review process. Your choice will not affect the review process for your paper. Should you decide to embrace this policy, we strongly encourage you to archive empirical datasets on Zenodo or Dataverse, following Google guidelines to dataset providers, and share analysis scripts on freely accessible code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.\n\nContact\n\nFeel free to contact the ICSSP 2024 Program Co-Chairs, John Noll and Jil Klünder, for additional information."
