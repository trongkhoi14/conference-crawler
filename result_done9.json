    "CallForPaper": "nWe invite submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results of software engineering for self-adaptive and self-managing systems, with a broad spectrum of topics of interest listed below. Note that SEAMS 2024 will use two submission rounds for the Research Track, with deadlines in October 2023 and December 2023, and with the possibility of submitting a revised version from the first round to the second as detailed below. Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library, and the conference proceedings will be published by IEEE CPS. A few selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version for the ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems.\n\nBackground\n\nToday we are building an exciting future in which autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, smart cities help solve public problems and achieve a higher quality of life, and service robots support social care workers or perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. These software-intensive systems must continuously preserve and optimize their operation despite uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource variability, evolving user needs, attacks and faults. The complexity of these systems demands them to adapt and manage themselves autonomously, although, in certain situations, human intervention may be beneficial to improve these systems’ operation. Adaptation also pervades less traditional application domains, such as engineering AI-based systems, human-centred design and development decisions, and the design of human-machine interactions.\n\nSEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference that applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection. This year we also encourage submissions exploring unconventional topics on new engineering approaches, such as the adaptivity of large language models and generative AI-based techniques, human-centred software design and development, and human-machine interactions). SEAMS aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to investigate, discuss, examine, and advance the fundamental principles, the state-of-the-art, and the solutions addressing critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems.\n\nTopics of Interest\n\nWe welcome research contributions to all topics related to engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems, including:\n\nFoundational Concepts\nSelf-* properties\nUncertainty\nRuntime models and variability\nMixed-initiative and human-in-the-loop/human-on-the-loop\nEthical challenges\nAdaptation vs Evolution\nEngineering Strategies\nAI and machine learning\nAutomatic synthesis techniques\nControl theory\nSearch-based techniques\nModel checking\nSimulation and digital twins\nHuman-centred software development\nEngineering Activities\nDomain/environment analysis\nRequirements elicitation\nSecurity and privacy\nArchitecture and design\nTesting and assurances\nAutomated maintenance\nSystematic reuse\nProcesses and methodologies\nSelf-adaptation for software engineering\nLanguages\nFormal notations for self-* properties\nDomain-specific languages\nProgramming language support\n\nApplication areas and domains include but are not limited to the industrial Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, cloud/fog/edge computing, bioengineering, robotics, smart environments, smart user interfaces, web applications, and automotive.\n\nTypes of Papers\n\nWe solicit three types of papers:\n\nResearch papers 10 pages of content + 2 pages of references: papers offering novel and mature research contributions and experiences gained from applying or evaluating research results in practice.\nShort papers 6 pages of content + 1 page of references: papers presenting ongoing research or new research ideas without a complete evaluation.\nCommunity debate 2 pages, possibly with a supporting video: Participants from industry and academia who would like to participate in the SEAMS 2024 community debate are strongly encouraged to submit a short position paper on the statement: “Should the adaptive software systems community re-visit bio-inspired algorithms given advances in ML and more general research attention on bio-diversity and sustainability?\" A submission should clearly take a position in favor or against the statement and support this position with arguments.\n\nFor additional information on how to submit papers to SEAMS 2024, please see the Submission section. Besides research papers, the SEAMS organizers encourage the submission of artifacts. Artifacts can be associated with research papers, or they can be standalone contributions. For both options, artifacts should be submitted to the artifact track.\n\nReview Criteria\n\nEach paper submitted to the Research Track will be reviewed by at least three PC members. The evaluation will be based on the following criteria:\n\nNovelty and Originality\nRelevance and Impact\nSoundness and Verifiability\nPresentation and Readability",

    "CallForPaper":  "ISSRE (International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering) is the leading conference on software reliability and it focuses on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.\n\nThe research track at ISSRE 2024 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results exploring new scientific ideas, contributing new evidence to established research directions, or reflecting on practical experience. Specifically, ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories: (1) full research regular (REG) papers, (2) practical experience reports (PER), and (3) tools and artefacts (TAR) papers. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category.\n\nREG papers should describe a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems. Novelty should be argued via concrete evidence and appropriate positioning within the state of the art. REG papers are also expected to clearly explain the validation process and its limitations.\nPER papers should provide an in-depth exposition of practical experiences ideally performed by a collaboration of researchers and industry practitioners. The key contribution of these papers should be lessons learned from the application of known research tools and methods related to ISSRE topics, or new knowledge acquired through empirical studies performed according to various research methodologies. Negative results are welcome, e.g., discussing where or why current research cannot be applied in an industrially relevant context.\nTAR papers should describe a new tool or artefact. Tool-focused TAR papers must present either a new tool or novel and substantial extensions to an existing tool. They should include a description of (i) the theoretical foundations, (ii) the design and implementation aspects, and (iii) experiments with realistic case studies. Making the tool publicly available is strongly encouraged. Artefact-focused TAR papers should cover (i) a working copy of the software and (ii) experimental data sets.\n\nThe ISSRE conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Authors are encouraged to disclose data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Should the paper be accepted, the authors will have the opportunity (and are encouraged to) submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) track, to enhance the reproducibility and quality of your research. By submitting your artifacts, you not only contribute to the progress of our field but also stand a chance to earn badges that will be displayed on your papers in the conference proceedings, showcasing the credibility and rigor of your work.\n\nAt least one author of every accepted paper is required to make a full author registration and present at the conference physically in Tsukuba.\n\nSpecial issues\n\nAn extended version of selected papers will be considered for publication in a special issue of an international top-quality journal. The name of the Journal will be announced.\n\nImportant dates (AoE)\nPaper submission deadline: May 15th, 2024 (AoE)May 10th, 2024 (AoE)\nAuthor rebuttal period: July 5th-July 8th, 2024 (AoE)\nNotification to authors: July 26th, 2024 (AoE)\nCamera ready papers: August 23rd, 2024 (AoE)\nPaper Categories\n\nSubmissions can be made in one of the following.\n\nREG papers: 12 pages (including references).\nPER papers: 12 pages (including references).\nTAR papers: 6 - 10 pages (including references).\n\nPapers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review.\n\nTopics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include development, analysis methods and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to:\n\nDependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability\nReliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures\nReliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting)\nSoftware testing and formal methods\nSoftware fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis\nMetrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security\nReliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems\nReliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering\nReliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability\nReliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS)\nReliability of model-based and auto-generated software\nReliability of open-source software\nReliability of software dealing with Big Data\nReliability of model-based and auto-generated software\nReliability of green and sustainable systems\nReliability of mobile systems\nReliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain, networks softwarization, 5G/6G, edge-to-cloud computing)\nNormative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability\nSocietal aspects of software reliability\nAnonymizing Rules\n\nAuthors shall anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgements). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, the names of case study subjects may be left un-anonymized, if the subject name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. In that case, they should avoid mentioning that a specific tool has been conceived and developed by them, as well as a paper that has been co-authored by them. The authors can provide the name of a case study subject software and the name of the entity developing it (private company or foundations); in case some of the authors are employees of the developing entity, the authors should not explicitly mention their affiliation but clarify potential threats to validity (e.g., familiarity with the subject), as appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:\n\nRemove authors' names and affiliations from the title page\nRemove acknowledgement of identifying names and funding sources\nUse care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.\nUse care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work.\nIf you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: \"Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2023].\" with the corresponding citation: \"[Anonymous 2023] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.\"\nIf you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email.\nIt is within the authors to use a non-anonymized version of the submitted work to, e.g., discuss it with colleagues, give talks, and publish it at ArXiV, but, in doing so, the authors cannot mention that the work is under submission to ISSRE 2024.\n\nSubmissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded.\n\nFormatting Rules\n\nSubmissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines as implemented by the following LaTeX/Word templates:\n\nLaTex Package (ZIP)\nWord Template (DOCX)\n\nEach paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of success. Please take a note of the following:\n\nSubmissions should be anonymous.\nThe first page must include the title of the paper and a maximum 200-word abstract.\nPlease take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers. Thus, describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them.\nThe first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (i.e., it has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper.\nThe use of color for figures and graphs is allowed only if the paper turns out to be readable if printed in grayscale.\nSymbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification.\nTry to limit the file size to less than 15 MB.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and better understand their results.\n\nPaper Submission\n\nPapers are submitted via Easychair at the following URL: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2024\n\nSubmissions will be reviewed by the program committee through a double-blind reviewing process, with a limited use of outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.\n\nChanges in the number and order of authors will not be allowed after the paper acceptance.\n\nAuthors must anonymize their submissions according to the guidelines given above. Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.\n\nReview Process and Author Response\n\nAfter the papers have been reviewed, but before the Program Committee/Board meeting, the reviews will be made available to the authors to respond to any factual errors in the reviews. Rebuttals do not include additional information about the research or a submission of an updated or revised paper. Author responses will be made available to all PC/PB members before the paper is discussed for selection in the PC/PB meeting. The submissions website will include rebuttal guidelines.\n\nBest Research Paper Award\n\nISSRE is pleased to announce the Best Research Paper Award, attributed every year to the best paper in the Research Track.\n\nConference Proceedings\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS). Papers presented at the conference will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and to all of the A&I (abstracting and indexing) partners (such as the EI Compendex).\n\nIEEE Conference Publishing Policies\n\nAll submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies <Submission Policies - IEEE Author Center Conferences>.\n\nIEEE Cross Check\n\nAll submissions will be screened for plagiarized material through the IEEE Cross Check portal.\n\nResearch PC Chairs\n\n\n Lei Ma (ma.lei@acm.org)\n The University of Tokyo / University of Alberta\n\n\n Roberto Pietrantuono (Roberto.pietrantuono@unina.it)\n University of Naples Federico II"
