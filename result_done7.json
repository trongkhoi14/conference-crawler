    "CallForPaper": "We are proud to announce that in 2024, the 35th International Conference on Principles of Diagnosis and Resilient Systems (DX’24) will take place in Póvoa de Varzim, Portugal, from September 24th to 26th 2024. To date, the focus of the DX workshop series has been on the principles and applications of diagnosis, i.e., the identification of root causes for encountered issues and unexpected scenarios, as well as on related techniques, such as prognostics, planning, and control. Moving forward, we would like to expand our focus on diagnosis to the particularly interesting topic of resilience, which is the intrinsic ability of a system to sustain its required operations when impacted by expected and unexpected contingencies that were potentially not considered during the design of the system. We are interested in papers that cover resilient design as well as approaches for operational resilience.\n\nThe annual DX conference is a forum to present state-of-the-art research and experience reports, to exchange and discuss emerging ideas, as well as to debate current issues and envisioned future challenges. Relevant research areas are related (but not limited) to fault diagnosis, monitoring, testing, debugging, verification, fault-adaptive control, intelligent decision-making, explanation and recommendation systems, (re-)configuration, (re-)planning, repair, resilient system design and operational resilience. Our focus is application-independent, so that we value submissions considering any kind of system, including digital, analog, mechanical, cyber-physical, biological, logical, ecological, ethical, economical, and social ones, no matter whether they are natural, or artificial, abstract or detailed.\n\nThe DX conference program committee welcomes submissions on any diagnosis- or resilient system-related topic, including:\n\nFormal theories and computation methods for diagnosis and resilient systems, including monitoring, fault detection and isolation, testing, decision making, repair and therapy, (re-)planning, (re-)configuration, fault tolerance, diagnosability analysis, and system design.\nModels for diagnosis and resilient systems, including discrete, discrete-event, qualitative, continuous, hybrid, probabilistic, behavioral, and functional models, as well as models resulting from approximation, abstraction, refinement, and reformulation approaches. Modeling approaches that scale to large systems are of specific interest.\nDiagnosis algorithms and processes, including strategies for measurement selection, active diagnosis/testing, sensor placement, embedded diagnosis, preventive diagnosis, fault adaptive control, distributed diagnosis, as well as human interaction with the diagnosis engine and other usability issues.\nTechnology supporting the design and operation of resilient systems, including strategies for making decisions, mission (re-)planning, system (re-)configuration, repair processes, active and passive knowledge acquisition, aggregating diagnostic information over time and space, exploiting diagnosis results over a system’s entire lifetime (from development to decommissioning), exploiting diagnostic information for system design evolution, as well as the local and global exploitation of diagnosis results (local in time, space or a system-of-systems context)\nSolutions to and formulations of computational issues faced during diagnosis and in resilient systems, e.g., addressing combinatorial (and state) explosion, the exploitation of structural and hierarchical knowledge, focusing strategies and heuristics, resource-bounded reasoning, requirements and restrictions related to real-time environments, and pre-compilation/pre-processing techniques.\nLearning-based systems to support monitoring, fault diagnosis, resilient design, and operational resilience.\nConnections and interplay between data-driven and/or analytic AI-based diagnosis methods and methods from related areas or tasks like FDI, control theory, statistics, machine and deep learning, knowledge representation, concept extraction, planning, optimization, autonomous systems, safety, verification, software engineering, debugging, as well as hardware instrumentation and testing.\n(Real-world) applications of diagnosis and system resilience, including scenarios in space, transportation, aeronautics, robotics, manufacturing, process engineering, energy, networks and services, ethics, economy, biotechnology, medical domains, and social/societal contexts. Case studies concerning a successful or failed technology transfer to a specific application are especially welcome.\n\nAll PhD students working on a relevant topic are encouraged to submit a description of their research to be considered for a special session focusing on mentoring PhD research. Depending on the number of submissions, this session will be organized as a panel or poster session. Accepted entries will be included in our archival proceedings in a dedicated section.\n\nRegular submissions are limited to 20 pages (including references and appendices) in the Dagstuhl Open Access Series in Informatics format as referenced on the conference website. PhD session submissions must be no longer than 16 pages. Authors must submit their papers and PhD session entries electronically via EasyChair as PDF files. The submissions will be peer-reviewed (single blind, authors can add their names), and accepted papers will be scheduled for either an oral or a poster presentation (a panel and/or poster presentation for accepted PhD session submissions).\n\nBy submitting a paper, all authors agree that for each accepted paper, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and attend in person. For PhD session entries, the PhD candidates must attend the conference and present their submissions. Please note that a registration accounts for one accepted paper. Exceptions require the consent of the organizers and for each additional paper an additional fee will be applied.\n\nThe program committee reserves the right to reject without review submissions that exceed page limits, violate the guidelines listed on the conference website, or are submitted in formats other than PDF. All submissions must be made through the conference EasyChair site. Resubmissions that have been accepted at venues without archival proceedings (workshops, ArXiv, …) are welcome when following the specific instructions provided in the submission guidelines."

We hope you will join our vision on “Speech and Beyond”.\n\nPaper Submission\n\nInterspeech 2024 seeks original and innovative papers covering all aspects of speech science and technology. The language of the conference is English, so papers must be written in English. The paper length is up to four pages in two columns with an additional page for references and acknowledgments only. Submitted papers must conform to the format defined in the paper kit provided on the conference website (and as an overleaf template) and may optionally be accompanied by multimedia files. Interspeech 2024 will follow a double-blind review process so papers submitted for review should not reveal the identity or affiliation of the authors. Authors must declare that their contributions are original and that they have not submitted their papers elsewhere for publication. Papers must be submitted electronically and will be evaluated through rigorous peer review on the basis of novelty and originality, technical correctness, clarity of presentation, key strengths, and quality of references. The Technical Programme Committee will decide which papers to include in the conference programme using peer review as the primary criterion, with secondary criteria of addressing the conference theme, and diversity across the programme as a whole.\n\nBlue Sky Track\n\nThis year, we also encourage the authors to consider submitting to the new BLUE SKY track of highly innovative papers in fields or directions that have not yet been explored. Large-scale experimental evaluation will not be required for papers in this track. Incremental work will not be accepted. If you think your work satisfies these requirements, please consider submitting a paper to this challenging and competitive track. Please note that to achieve the objectives of this BLUE SKY track, we will ask the most experienced reviewers (mainly our ISCA Fellow members) to assess the proposals.\n\nClick here for further information regarding the procedure for submitting Papers. \n\nVenue\n\nInterspeech 2024 will take place in Kos Island, Greece at the Kipriotis Hotels & Conference Center (KICC).\n\nTo stay updated, we invite prospective participants to regularly visit the website www.interspeech2024.org and reach out to IS24 PCO, Ortra, at interspeech2024@ortra.com and/or ISCA conference coordinators at conferences@isca-speech.org.\n\nScientific Areas and Topics\n\nInterspeech 2024 embraces a broad range of science and technology in speech, language and communication, including – but not limited to – the following topics:\n\n● Speech Perception, Production and Acquisition\n\n\t\n\n● Speech Synthesis\n\n\n\n\n● Phonetics, Phonology, and Prosody\n\n\t\n\n● Spoken Language Generation\n\n\n\n\n● Paralinguistics in Speech and Language\n\n\t\n\n● Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n\n\n\n● Analysis of Conversation\n\n\t\n\n● Spoken Dialogue and Conversational AI Systems\n\n\n\n\n● Speech, Voice, and Hearing Disorders\n\n\t\n\n● Spoken Language Translation, Information Retrieval, Summarization\n\n\n\n\n● Speaker and Language Identification\n\n\t\n\n● Technologies and Systems for New Applications\n\n\n\n\n● Speech and Audio Signal Analysis\n\n\t\n\n● Resources and Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n● Speech Coding and Enhancement\n\n\t\n\n● Beyond traditional speech topics (not limited to the provided list)\n\nCONTACTS\n\nFor all questions related to scientific aspects: tpcchairs@interspeech2024.org\n\nFor general questions: generalchairs@interspeech2024.org\n\nClick here to download the Call For Papers"
