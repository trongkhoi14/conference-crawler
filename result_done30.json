    "CallForPaper": "ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM\n\nThe International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the eighteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nWe seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.\n\nWork that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.\n\nAuthors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.\n\nPAPER SUBMISSIONS\n\nPlease select Paper Submissions from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.\n\nAny questions regarding paper submissions should be sent to the Program Committee Chairs (Claudio Gentille and Aldo Pacchiano) at the email address isaim-l@lists.ou.edu.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\nPaper submission\tOctober 17 (extended from Oct 9), 2023 (11:59 PM PDT)\nNotification\tNovember 15 (extended from Nov 8), 2023 (11:59 PM PDT)\nFinal papers due\tNovember 29, 2023 (11:59 PM PDT)\nWorkshop\tJanuary 8-10, 2024, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida"

    "CallForPaper": "IPEC 2024\nScope\n\nThe International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC) is an annual conference covering all aspects of parameterized and exact algorithms and complexity. Its 19th edition will be part of ALGO 2024, which also hosts ESA 2024 and other specialized conferences and workshops.\n\nImportant Dates\nAbstract submission: 26 June 2024 (AoE)\nPaper submission: 30 June 2024 (AoE)\nNotification: 05 August 2024\nConference: 04-06 September 2024\nCamera-ready version: early October\n\nSubmission Guidelines\n\nThe papers are submitted via EasyChair.\n\nEach submission is required to be in the LIPIcs format. We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper, with title page containing only the title and abstract and the references placed at the very end of paper. However, the first 12 pages (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat these 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion). PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions, but these submissions will not be eligible for the best student paper and the best paper. Besides this constraint, to be eligible for the best student paper, all the authors must be students at the time of the submission.\n\nWhen submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:\n\nFamily member or close friend.\nPh.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.\nSame affiliation.\nInvolved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)\nReviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).\nFrequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.\n\nInvited talks\n\nThe invited tutorial will be given by Szymon Toruńczyk (University of Warsaw, Poland).\nFurthermore, IPEC will host an invited talk by (one of) the 2024 EATCS-IPEC Nerode Prize winner(s).\n\nPACE 2024\n\nThe Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge (PACE) was conceived in Fall 2015 to deepen the relationship between parameterized algorithms and practice. Topics from multivariate algorithms, exact algorithms, fine-grained complexity, and related fields are in scope.\n\nThis year’s challenge is about the one-sided crossing minimization problem (OCM). This problem involves arranging the nodes of a bipartite graph on two layers (typically horizontal), with one of the layers fixed, aiming to minimize the number of edge crossings. OCM is one of the basic building block used for drawing hierarchical graphs. It is NP-hard, even for trees, but admits good heuristics, can be constant-factor approximated and solved in FPT time.\n\nFor more details on the timeline and past challenges, please visit the PACE website.\n\nCommittees\n\n\nProgram Committee\nÉdouard Bonnet (ENS Lyon, LIP, France) (co-chair)\nNick Brettell (Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand)\nDavid Eppstein (University of California, Irvine, USA)\nPiotr Faliszewski (AGH University, Kraków, Poland)\nAndreas Emil Feldmann (University of Sheffield, UK)\nJacob Focke (CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, Saarbrucken, Germany)\nPanos Giannopoulos (City, University of London, UK)\nPetr Hliněný (Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic)\nLars Jaffke (University of Bergen, Norway)\nPetteri Kaski (Aalto University, Finland)\nEunjung Kim (CNRS, France and KAIST, South Korea)\nTuukka Korhonen (University of Bergen, Norway)\nStephan Kreutzer (TU Berlin, Germany)\nPaloma T.

    "CallForPaper": "On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the 17th International Work-Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (IWANN2023), we are pleased to invite you to participate in this event that will be held in June 2023 in Ponta Delgada (Sao Miguel, Azores Islands, Portugal). This gathering will bring people physically together again after 4 years in the one of the most beautiful Atlantic’s islands, conducive to creativity and inspiration.\n\nThis biennial meeting seeks to provide a discussion forum for scientists, engineers, educators and students about the latest discoveries and realizations in the foundations, theory, models and applications of systems inspired by nature, as well as in emerging areas related to the above items, using computational intelligence methodologies. As in previous editions, we strongly emphasize the wide range of topics comprised under the umbrella of IWANN2023 and, in particular, we focus on trending topics such as Deep Learning and Ethics in AI. It’s confirmed one tutorial about “From Deep Learning to Deep Understanding”.\n\nWe present below a non-exhaustive list of areas of interest for the congress to get a flavour of the IWANN23’ orientation:\n\nMathematical and theoretical methods in computational intelligence\nDeep Learning\nLearning and adaptation\nEmulation of cognitive functions\nBio-inspired systems and neuro-engineering\nAdvanced topics in computational intelligence\nAgent based models\nTime series forecasting\nRobotics and cognitive systems\nInteractive systems and BCI\nMachine Learning for 4.0 industry solutions\nAI Health\nAI in 5G technology\nSocial and Ethical aspects of AI\nGeneral Applications of AI\n\nThe approach will be both theoretical and practical, through invited talks, tutorials, workshops, posters, presentation of demos and functional prototypes. Besides, we offer the possibility to carry out a limited number of virtual presentations for those who want to participate but have serious difficulties to travel. The proceedings will include all the presented communications to the conference. As in previous editions of IWANN, we are arranging the publication of the proceedings with Springer-Verlag as Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and the books will be available shortly after the Congress in order allow the authors to incorporate suggestions and improvements from the presentations. It is also foreseen the publication of extended versions of selected papers in special issues of several prestigious journals. Previous congresses led to special issues of Neural Computing and Applications, Plos One and Neural Processing Letters. We are working to have at least the same collaborations."

Since its inception in 1994, WAFR has established a reputation as a, if not the, premier venue for presenting algorithmic work related to robotics. In 2024 we celebrate 30 years of WAFR and we are planning some special events related to this milestone.\n\nThe focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. These algorithms process inputs from noisy sensors, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high-and low-level actions at different time horizons, and execute these actions on actuators with limited precision. The design and analysis of robot algorithms raise a unique combination of questions from many fields, including but not limited to:\n\nAlgorithmic approaches to human-robot interaction,\nComputational geometry and topology,\nControl theory and optimization,\nDistributed and parallel methods,\nDecision theory and game theory,\nGeometrical and physical modeling,\nMachine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, representation learning, imitation learning\nPlanning and reasoning under uncertainty,\nProbabilistic and sampling-based algorithms,\nSensing and perception,\nTask and motion planning, and\nTheoretical computer science.\n\nIn addition to these topics, we also encourage papers on applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, including those beyond the traditional scope of robotics, such as:\n\nAssistive and service robotics,\nBrain-controlled robots,\nComputational biology,\nComputer animation, graphics and animation, VR/AR,\nLegged locomotion,\nManufacturing and automation,\nMulti-agent systems,\nSensor networks and IoT devices,\nSurgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, rehabilitation robots,\nTransportation networks and systems.\n\nThe workshop proceedings will be published in the Springer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR) series and selected papers will be invited for publication in special issues of relevant journals.\n\nImportant Dates\n\nMay 31 June 13, 2024: Paper submission deadline\nJuly 31 August 14, 2024: Acceptance notification\nSeptember 9, 2024: Final manuscript for website\nOctober 7-9, 2024: WAFR 2024\nNovember 22, 2024: Camera-ready manuscript for SPAR book\n\n\nFinal Manuscript Submssion deadline\n\nhotel reservation deadline.\nJune 19:\ntravel grant application deadline.-->\nOctober 7-9: WAFR 2024\n\nInformation for Authors\n\nInformation on manuscript preparation and on the submission process is available at this link."

The submissions are expected to be fully self-contained (including references). In the case that the 8-page format is insufficient for the whole submission, authors are encouraged to place some of the material in an optional appendix. This appendix will not be published in the proceedings and hence should not be referenced within the body of the 8-page paper, but it will be used to evaluate the submission. Please check also the Guide for authors of Procedia Computer Science.\n\nSimultaneous submission of papers to any other conference with published proceedings, as well as the submission of previously published papers, is not allowed. At least one author of each accepted papers must register for the conference to be included in the program.\n\nThe submission process must be completed electronically through Easy Chair."

The single-track format brings together academic and industry researchers and practitioners to engage in fruitful and constructive discussions. NOSSDAV encourages papers identifying fundamental open problems in multimedia systems research, advocate new radical ideas or offer counterarguments or critique on the existing state of the art; NOSSDAV prefers exciting-even-if-incomplete papers or reports on promising ideas that may be supported by well-reasoned arguments.\n\nNOSSDAV takes a broad perspective on all areas of multimedia systems. Authors are especially encouraged to submit papers with real-world experimental results and datasets. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to):\n\nVirtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and immersive systems\nDeep learning approaches to improve multimedia delivery and processing\nCloud architectures for multimedia coding and processing\nWireless, mobile, IoT and embedded systems for multimedia applications\nMedical, surveillance and autonomous driving multimedia systems\nNetwork-distributed media processing\nNetworked GPUs/TPUs, graphics and virtual environments\nAudio/Image/Video Analytics Systems\nSystem Support for Multimedia Interaction with humans\nInternet-Scale Multimedia Systems"

    "CallForPaper":  "Context\n\nThe International Systems and Software Product Lines Conference (SPLC) is the leading conference on the variability and configuration of hardware and software systems. Researchers, practitioners, and educators present and discuss the most recent research breakthroughs, ideas, trends, experiences, challenges, and solutions to advance the state-of-the-art. SPLC is ranked as a top conference, and for this 28th edition, we strive to continue the success of previous years by welcoming high-quality submissions for the research track with a special emphasis on the theme of ‘Management of Quality in Software Product Lines’.\n\nThis theme acknowledges the importance of managing the quality of software product lines and of the methods and techniques defined to measure and reason about quality, including the modeling of non-functional requirements and how they are related to variability models, the association of quality measures with either features or configurations of software product lines, the quality-driven analysis of configuration spaces, the definition of metrics to measure the quality of selected samples for testing and the definition of prediction models for non-functional properties. This theme completes the topics of the conference (see below), and we continue welcoming submissions in numerous closely related areas, such as configurable systems, product configuration, and software variability.\n\nSimilar to past years, we will award the best research paper and the best student research paper. We are negotiating an open special issue with a top-tier journal. Authors will be invited to submit enhanced versions of their work to the special issue. Details of the call will be published on this website.\n\n \nTopics\n\nThe following is a list of topics of interest to SPLC, but we also invite submissions to related topics, i.e., this list is by no means exhaustive.  Feel free to ask the track chairs if in doubt (see below).\n\nAI: genetic algorithms, neural networks, and machine learning for product lines\nArchitecture, design, and visualization of product lines\nDynamic software product lines, reconfigurable systems, (self-)adaptive systems\nEvolution, maintenance, and continuous integration for product lines (e.g., DevOps)\nFormal methods and SPL verification techniques (e.g., program analysis, model checking)\nGreen and sustainable technologies for variation\nHuman, organizational, and social aspects of product lines (e.g., BPM, collaborative modeling and development, cooperative configuration processes, economics, program comprehension)\nLanguage product lines and domain-specific and programming languages for product lines\nMulti-product lines, program families, product lines of product lines, software ecosystems\nNon-functional properties and quality management: modeling, analysis, and optimization (e.g., performance, energy), quality-aware analysis, quality-driven configuration\nReverse engineering, variability mining, and refactoring (e.g., migration from clone-and-own)\nRecommender systems for configurators and feature models (e.g., CSP/SAT/SMT solvers)\nSpecification and modeling of SPL (e.g., domain-specific modeling, model-driven engineering)\nTesting product lines (e.g., product sampling, test-case selection and prioritization, mutations)\nVariability management and variability modeling (e.g., feature models, decision models)\n \nSubmission Guidelines\n\nThe research track is open to submissions in two categories:\n\nFull papers describing original results of conceptual, theoretical, empirical, or experimental research. The papers in this category must rely on theoretical or empirical evaluation.\nShort papers describing emerging ideas or outstanding challenges along with possible approaches for resolving them.\n\nThe page limit is 10 pages of content (+ 2 pages for references) for full papers and 5 pages of content (+ 2 pages for references) for short papers. Each submission will be carefully reviewed by at least three members of the research track program committee.\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated on the basis of the following criteria:\n\nOriginality (including an appropriate comparison to related work)\nThe importance of contribution (including potential applicability of the results to practice/industry)\nSoundness (including appropriate evidence for the main claims, typically from a quantitative and/or qualitative evaluation)\nTransparency (methodological steps are described in sufficient detail, artifacts are made available, or a justification is included as to why they are not made available)\npresentation quality\n \nSubmission link\n\nSubmissions need to be sent using EasyChair:\nhttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=splc2024 (Research Track)\n\n \n\nDoubled-Blind Review Process\n\nIn order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the SPLC 2024 Research Track will follow a double-blind review process. The identity of the authors will not be known to the program committee at any time during the process. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way.\n\nAuthors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission.\nAuthors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in the third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” instead of “our prior work”.\nAuthors should avoid providing URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, data sets). The paper can mention the existence of such sites, but visiting such sites should be optional to conduct the review.\nAuthors should anonymize author-revealing company names yet can provide general characteristics of the organizations involved needed to understand the context of the paper.\n\nAuthors who have further questions on the double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email. Papers that do not comply with the double-blind review process will be desk-rejected.\n\n \n\nPaper Formatting Instructions\n\nThe SPLC proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library.\n\nSubmissions must adhere to the latest ACM Master Article Template:\nhttps://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template\n\nLatex users should use the “sigconf” option, so they are recommended to use the template found in “sample-sigconf.tex”. In this way, the following latex code can be placed at the start of the latex document to create a double-column layout:\n\n\\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}\n\n\\acmConference[SPLC’24]{28th ACM International Systems and Software Product Lines Conference}{ September 2-6, 2024}{Luxembourg}\n\n \n\nSubmission Policies\n\nPapers submitted for consideration to SPLC must not have been already published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period. Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\n\nPlease ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of the published authors.  ACM is committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.\n\n \n\nArtifact Evaluation\n\nAuthors of accepted and conditionally accepted research papers are invited to submit the artifacts associated with the paper for evaluation.\n\nAccording to ACM’s “Result and Artifact Review and Badging” policy, an “artifact” is “a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself [… which can include] software systems, scripts used to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or scripts used to analyze results.”\n\nTo submit an artifact, you should submit via EasyChair (select the Research Artifacts track) a PDF file containing:\n\na stable URL (or DOI) to the artifacts – the page must include the steps or general instructions to execute/analyze the artifact; and\nthe paper as an appendix.\n\nEach artifact submission will be reviewed by at least two reviewers. At this stage, we do not require the anonymization of the artifact’s authors. The Artifact Evaluation PC does not overlap with the Research Track PC. The acceptance of artifacts related to conditionally accepted papers is subject to the acceptance of the corresponding papers.\n\nAccepted artifacts will receive one of the following badges on the first page of the paper, table of contents, and in the ACM Digital Library:\n\nArtifacts Evaluated – This badge is applied to papers whose associated artifacts have successfully completed an independent audit. Artifacts need not be made publicly available to be considered for this badge. However, they do need to be made available to reviewers. Two levels are distinguished, only one of which should be applied in any instance:\nFunctional – The artifacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of verification and validation.\nReusable – The artifacts associated with the paper are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. That is, they have all the qualities of the Artifacts Evaluated – Functional level, but, in addition, they are very\ncarefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing are facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are strictly adhered to.\nArtifacts Available – This badge is applied to papers in which associated artifacts have been made permanently available for retrieval. Author-created artifacts relevant to this paper have been placed on a publically accessible archival repository. A DOI or link to\nthis repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.\n\nEach accepted research paper associated with an accepted artifact must provide a link to the artifact in the camera-ready version of the paper.

    "CallForPaper": "Deadlines extended! Check out the new dates!\n\nStatic Analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served for over 30 years as the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area.\n\nImportant Dates (All deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth))\n\nPaper submission: Sunday, May 5th, Sunday May 19th, 2024 (Extended Deadline)\nArtifact submission: Sunday, May 12th, Wednesday May 22nd, 2024 (Extended Deadline)\nAuthor response: Monday, June 17th - Wednesday, June 19th, Wednesday, June 26th - Friday, June 28th, 2024\nNotification: Sunday, July 7th, Tuesday, July 16th, 2024\nCamera ready: Monday, August 5th, Monday, August 12th, 2024\nTopics\nThe technical program for SAS 2024 will consist of invited lectures and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcomed on all aspects of program analysis analysis, including, but not limited to:\nAbstract interpretation\nAutomated deduction\nData flow analysis\nDebugging techniques\nDeductive methods\nEmerging applications\nModel-checking\nData science\nProgram optimizations and transformations\nProgram synthesis\nProgram verification\nMachine learning and verification\nSecurity analysis\nTool environments and architectures\nTheoretical frameworks\nType checking\nDistributed or networked systems\nAll paper submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity.\n\nSubmission link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sas24\n\nWe welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the following in the NEAT (New questions/areas, Experience, Announcement, Tool) category:\nWell-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas.\nExperience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies\nBrief announcements of work in progress\nTool papers\nSubmissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic, object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU programming. We do not impose a page limit for submitted papers but we encourage brevity as reviewers have a limited time that they can spend on each paper. With the exception of NEAT papers, all papers will follow a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. The identity of the authors for the NEAT papers will be therefore known to the reviewers.\n\nPapers must be written and presented in English. A submitted paper must describe original work and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.\n\nAll submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process will include a rebuttal period where authors have the opportunity to respond to preliminary reviews on the paper.\nRadhia Cousot Award\nThe program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot and her fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences.\nArtifacts\nAs in previous years, we encourage authors to submit a virtual machine image containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper review. For more details, please visit the SAS 2024 Artifacts page.\nSubmission Details\nLightweight Double-Blind Requirement\nAll regular papers will follow a double-blind process, where author names and affiliations are hidden for initial review. Author names will be revealed to a reviewer only after their review has been submitted. To facilitate this process, submitted regular papers must adhere to the following: (1) Author names and affiliations must be omitted and (2) References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.\nNEAT Papers Content\nNew problems papers are an opportunity to discuss visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and impactful solutions in the field of static analysis from both a research and applications perspective. Such papers are encouraged to take assertive positions and be forward-looking and aim for lively and insightful discussions that are influential to future research directions in static analysis. NEAT papers will be handled in singe-blind way. User experience & Industrial reports & Case studies papers describe the use of static analysis in industrial settings or in any chosen application domains. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to present original research results but are expected to contain applications of static analysis as well as a comprehensive evaluation in the chosen application domain. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting, reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience, and compare experiences with different analyzers highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Brief announcements of work in progress papers may describe work in progress. A submission that is not selected for regular presentation may be invited for a brief announcement.\nSubmission Guidelines\nThe SAS 2024 proceedings will be published by Springer in their LNCS series. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, for LaTeX, Overleaf, or Word, for the preparation of their papers. The corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made."

All regular rejected papers will automatically be considered for brief announcements. Titles of regular papers that should not be considered for this option should mention “full paper only” after the title. Submissions must use the final ACM “sigconf” format from https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. More details are at https://spaa.acm.org/submission-guidelines/.\n\nRegular Papers:\n\nA regular paper submission must report on original research that has not been previously or concurrently published.  Submitted manuscripts may not exceed ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages excluding bibliography. All necessary details to substantiate the main claims of the paper should be included either in the body of the paper or in a supplementary material. However, the reviewers are not obligated to read the supplementary material.  \n\nBrief Announcements:\n\nExamples of good brief announcements include: work in progress, announcement of tools/libraries, challenge problems posted to the community, and corrections to earlier results. Brief announcements may also include smaller results of interest. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed three (3) single-spaced double-column pages for brief announcements including bibliography.\n\nTheory vs. Experiments\n\nA submission naturally falls into one of the following three categories.\n\nA. Theory (main contributions are theoretical)\nB. Experiments (main contributions are experimental)\nC. Theory and Experiments (main contributions are a mix of theory and experiments)\n\nTo help assigning suitable reviewers, please indicate during the submission process to which category the submission belongs.\n\nDouble-Blind Policy:\n\nSPAA 2024 will employ a lightweight double-blind review process. That means, the submission should omit authors’ names, affiliations, and contact information. In addition, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. Any supplemental materials, if applicable, should also be anonymized. However, authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of the paper as they normally would, such as submitting them to arXiv or giving talks on their research ideas. The reviewers will be asked to refrain from actively looking for the identity of the authors via web search.\n\nConflict of Interest Policy:\n\nTo ensure a fair and high-quality reviewing process we ask ALL authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts with the PC members at the submission site.  The following categories are considered as a conflict of interest:\n\nAcademic advisor or advisee (with no time limit)\nPostdoctoral mentor or mentee (with no time limit) \nCollaborators within the past three years, including a joint research or development project, a joint paper, or a funding relationship\nMembers of the same institution within the past 3 years\nFamily members or close friends\nSomeone involved in an alleged incident of harassment (not required that the incident be reported)\nAnyone whose relationship with an author would prevent the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment\n\nNote that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict.  Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit.  If an author believes that he or she has a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above or if he or she is uncertain, the author is encouraged to contact the program chair.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nIf an author has any further questions regarding the policies listed above, please contact the PC chair Erez Petrank by email (erez AT cs DOT technion DOT ac DOT il) and prefix the subject title with “[SPAA 24]”."
