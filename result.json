    "CallForPaper": "SCOPE\n\nKnowledge Engineering (KE) refers to all technical, scientific and social aspects involved in building, maintaining and using knowledge-based systems. KE is a multidisciplinary field, bringing in concepts and methods from several computer science domains such as artificial intelligence, databases, expert systems, decision support systems and information systems. From the software development point of view, KE uses principles that are strongly related to software engineering. KE is also related to logic (both in mathematics and philosophy domains) and to the cognitive and social sciences and socio-cognitive engineering. Knowledge is considered to be produced by humans and structured according to our understanding of how human reasoning and logic works. Currently, KE is mostly related with the construction of shared conceptual frameworks, often designated as ontologies, hence the relevance given to this term in our conference.\n\nOntology Development (OD) aims at building reusable semantic structures that can be informal vocabularies, catalogs, glossaries as well as more complex finite formal structures specifying types of entities and types of relationships relevant within a certain domain. Ontologies have been gaining interest and acceptance in computational audiences. For example, formal ontologies are increasingly used as one of the main sources of software development and methodologies for this end can be adapted to include ontology development. A wide range of applications is emerging, especially given the current web emphasis, including library science, ontology-enhanced search, e-commerce and business process design. Of particular interest, is the development of ontologies and/or methods in the fields of enterprise engineering and enterprise architecture as it has been proven that many problems in software development occur due to incomplete specifications of an enterprise's needs, leading to a huge lack of success in software projects. It is then natural that one should strive to more fully capture and specify enterprise knowledge.\n\nKEOD aims at becoming a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in the study and development of methodologies and technologies for Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development.\n\n\n\nCONFERENCE TOPICS\n\n\n\nSemantic Web\nOntology Engineering\nOntology Matching and Alignment\nOntology Sharing and Reuse\nNatural Language Processing\nEnterprise Engineering\nDomain Ontologies\nApplications and Case-Studies\nDomain Analysis and Modeling\nEnterprise Ontology\nIntegration and Interoperability\nKnowledge Acquisition\nKnowledge Engineering\nKnowledge Representation\nOntology Tools\nReference Models\nFoundational Ontologies\nIC3K KEYNOTE SPEAKERS\nCarlo Sansone, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e delle Tecnologie dell'Informazione, University of Naples Federico II, Italy\nNirmalie Wiratunga, RGU's School of Computing, United Kingdom\nJoão Gama, University of Porto, Portugal\n\nPAPER SUBMISSION\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas.\n\nAuthors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics.

    "CallForPaper": "SCOPE\n\nThe International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.\n\nThis conference aims at fostering the further development and application of model-based techniques for the construction and analysis of software and systems. Papers reporting on original work in any of the areas listed below are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors will be published in the MODELSWARD proceedings. The submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three experts in this area, and acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. The conference is open to full research and (short) work-in-progress papers. Sessions are planned for both oral and poster presentations.\n\nCONFERENCE AREAS\n\nEach of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:\n\n1. METHODOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND PLATFORMS\n2. APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\n3. MODELING LANGUAGES, TOOLS AND ARCHITECTURES\n\n\n\n\nAREA 1: METHODOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND PLATFORMS\n\n\nAgile Model-Based Development\nBusiness Process Management (Modeling, Enactment and Execution)\nFrameworks for Model-Based Development\nMulti-level and Multi-view Modeling\nModel Transformations and Generative Approaches\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) for Modeling Support\nSoftware and Systems Engineering\nAREA 2: APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\n\n\nModel-Based Software Development\nModel-Based Development of Cyber Physical Systems\nModel-Based Engineering of Digital Twins\nEnterprise Architecture Modeling\nModel-Based Product Lines\nModel Execution and Simulation\nModel Quality Assessment\nModel-Based Testing and Validation\nModel Management\nModeling for AI Applications\nAREA 3: MODELING LANGUAGES, TOOLS AND ARCHITECTURES\n\n\nGeneral-Purpose Modeling Languages and Standards\nDomain-Specific Modeling\nModeling Language Engineering\nModeling Language Syntax and Semantics\nReasoning about Models\nModel Transformation\nModeling Environments\nKEYNOTE SPEAKERS\n\nMODELSWARD 2025 will have several invited keynote speakers, who are internationally recognized experts in their areas. Their names are not yet confirmed.\n\nPAPER SUBMISSION\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas.\n\nAuthors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity.\n\nWhen submitting a complete paper please note that only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to read INSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism thoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.\n\nAll papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail.\n\n\n\n \nPUBLICATIONS\n\nAll accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support.\nSCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (http://www.crossref.org/) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).\nThe proceedings will be submitted for indexation by SCOPUS, Google Scholar, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, EI and Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nConference Date: 26 - 28 February, 2025\n\n\nRegular Papers\nPaper Submission: October 2, 2024\nAuthors Notification: December 4, 2024\nCamera Ready and Registration: December 20, 2024\n\n\n\nPosition Papers\nPaper Submission: November 13, 2024\nAuthors Notification: December 20, 2024\nCamera Ready and Registration: January 13, 2025\n\n\nWorkshops\nWorkshop Proposal: October 17, 2024\n\n\nDoctoral Consortium\nPaper Submission: January 10, 2025\nAuthors Notification: January 23, 2025\nCamera Ready and Registration: January 31, 2025\n\n\nSpecial Sessions\nSpecial Session Proposal: October 17, 2024\n\n\nTutorials\nTutorial Proposal: January 17, 2025\n\n\nDemos\nDemo Proposal: January 17, 2025\n\n\nPanels\nPanel Proposal: January 17, 2025\n\n\nAbstracts\nAbstract Submission: January 10, 2025\nAuthors Notification: January 23, 2025\nCamera Ready and Registration: January 31, 2025\n\n\nSECRETARIAT\n\nMODELSWARD Secretariat\nAddress: Avenida de S.

    "CallForPaper": "SCOPE\n\nCOMPLEXIS – The International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk, aims at becoming a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing innovative views on all aspects of Complex Information Systems, in different areas such as Informatics, Telecommunications, Computational Intelligence, Biology, Biomedical Engineering and Social Sciences. Information is pervasive in many areas of human activity – perhaps all – and complexity is a characteristic of current Exabyte-sized, highly connected and hyper dimensional, information systems. COMPLEXIS is expected to provide an overview of the state of the art as well as upcoming trends, and to promote discussion about the potential of new methodologies, technologies and application areas of complex information systems, in the academic and corporate world.\nCOMPLEXIS seeks papers reporting research work, applications or case-studies, on topics indicated below in the section “Conference Areas”. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Both technological and social-oriented papers are accepted. All papers must describe original work, not previously published or submitted to another conference. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of COMPLEXIS under an ISBN, and will be indexed by major indexes. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports (regular papers) and work-in-progress reports (position papers) are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.\nSpecial sessions, dedicated to case-studies and focused presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in holding a tutorial, workshop or special session are invited to contact the conference secretariat or visit the conference website.\n\n\nCONFERENCE AREAS\n\nEach of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive.
